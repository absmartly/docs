# Get Started

Welcome to the ABsmartly Documentation.

ABsmartly is an advanced experimentation and feature flagging platform designed to help teams validate ideas quickly, measure impact reliably and roll out changes safely. The platform provides everything you need to design experiments, expose users consistently, 
measure impact with robust metrics and make evidence based product decisions.

This documentation will guide you through how to use the platform, integrate it into your product and understand the core concepts behind trustworthy experimentation.

## Documentation structure

The documentation is divided into a few main sections to help you find what you need easily.

### Product Documentation
This [section](./web-console-docs/overview) explains how to use the ABsmartly Web Console to run experiment and feature flags.

You will find guides on:
- [creating](./web-console-docs/experiments/creating-an-experiment) and managing experiments  
- defining [goals](./web-console-docs/goals-and-metrics/goals/overview) and [metrics](./web-console-docs/goals-and-metrics/metrics/overview)
- using [feature flags](./web-console-docs/feature-flags/creating-a-feature)
- tracking [events](./web-console-docs/events/the-events-page)  
- managing [users, teams and permissions](./web-console-docs/users-teams-permissions/ownership-and-permissions)  
- configuring workspaces and settings  
- using the [LaunchPad browser extension](./web-console-docs/launchpad-browser-extension/getting-started)

If you use ABsmartly day to day to run experiments or feature flags, this is where you will spend most of your time.

### APIs & SDKs

This section contains all technical resources for implementing ABsmartly in your product.

You will find:
- [SDK documentation](./apis-and-sdks/sdk-documentation/) for client side, server side and mobile

## What to do next

If you are new to ABsmartly, we recommend starting with:
1. **Product Documentation → Getting Started**  
2. **APIs & SDKs** (choose the SDK you need to integrate first)  
3. **Experiments** to learn how to create, run and analyse your first test  

You can explore the rest of the documentation as you become more familiar with the platform.
