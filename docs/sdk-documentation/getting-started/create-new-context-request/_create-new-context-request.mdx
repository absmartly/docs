In order to start linking your experiments from the Web Console to your
application, you will need to create a context. When you instantiate a context,
you should pass all known characteristics of the current user. These
characteristics are known as "units".

You can use anything as a unit. For example, you can pass an internal user id or
email address. You could also pass a `device_id` that you store in a first-
party cookie or a mobile application `UUID`.

:::info Keep In Mind
The units that you pass must first be declared on your A/B Smartly Web Console
by going to `Settings -> Units`

<img

  alt="An example of the units list in settings on the web console"
/>
:::

:::caution
Experiments that are tracked by a unit which is not passed here will be turned off
in this request and the control treatment will be shown instead.

#### Create A New Context With Async/Await

#### Create A New Context With Pre-Fetched Data

When doing full-stack experimentation with A/B Smartly, we recommend only creating a
context once on the server-side. Creating a context involves a round-trip
to the A/B Smartly event collector. We can avoid repeating the round-trip on
the client-side by sending the server-side data embedded in the first document,
for example, by rendering it on the template. We can then initialize the
A/B Smartly context on the client-side directly with it.

<CodeBlock language="html">{JsPreFetchedData}</CodeBlock>

#### Refreshing the Context with Fresh Experiment Data

For long-running single-page-applications (SPA), the context is usually
created once when the application is first reached. However, any experiments
being tracked in your production code, but started after the context was
created, will not be triggered. To mitigate this, we can use the
refreshInterval option when creating the context.

<CodeBlock language="js">{JsRefreshWithFreshData}</CodeBlock>

Alternatively, the `refresh()` method can be called manually. The `refresh()`
method pulls updated experiment data from the A/B Smartly collector and will
trigger recently started experiments when `treatment()` is called again.

<CodeBlock language="js">{JsRefreshWithRefreshMethod}</CodeBlock>

#### HTTP request timeout

It is possible to set a timeout per individual HTTP request, overriding the
global timeout set for all request when instantiating the SDK object.

Here is an example of setting a timeout only for the `createContext` request.

<CodeBlock language="js">{JsHttpRequestTimeout}</CodeBlock>

#### HTTP Request cancellation

Sometimes it is useful to cancel an inflight HTTP request, for example, when
the user is navigating away. The A/B Smartly SDK also supports a cancellation
via an `AbortSignal`. An implementation of AbortController is provided for older
platforms, but will use the native implementation where available.

Here is an example of a cancellation scenario.

**Creating a New Context With Pre-Fetched Data**

When doing full-stack experimentation with A/B Smartly, we recommend creating a
context only once on the server-side. Creating a context involves a round-trip
to the A/B Smartly event collector. We can avoid repeating the round-trip on
the client-side by sending the server-side data embedded with other application
data. We can then initialize the A/B Smartly context directly with it.

<CodeBlock language="swift">{SwiftPreFetchedData}</CodeBlock>

**Setting Extra Units**

You can add additional units to a context by calling the `setUnit()` or
`setUnits()` methods. These methods may be used, for example, when a user logs in
to your application and you want to use the new unit type in the context.

:::caution Please Note
You cannot override an already set unit type as that would be a change of
identity, and would crash your application. In this case, you must create a new
context instead. The `setUnit()` and `setUnits()` methods can be called before
the context is ready.

#### Refreshing the context with fresh experiment data

For long-running contexts, the context is usually created once when the
application is first reached. However, any experiments being tracked in your
production code, but started after the context was created, will not be
triggered. To mitigate this, we can use the `setRefreshInterval()` method on the
context config.

initialize the A/B Smartly context on the client-side directly with it. The
Vue2 SDK also supports this optimized usage.

In this example, we assume the variable `prefectedContextData` contains the
pre-fetched data previously injected.
