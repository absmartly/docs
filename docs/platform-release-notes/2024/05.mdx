# May 2024

We're thrilled to unveil the latest update to our platform, featuring a
range of exciting new features designed to elevate your experience and
streamline your workflow.

## Templates

Create feature and experiment templates to ensure consistency across teams
and improve consistency in experiment setups.

## Report Block

Experiments and features now prominently display reasons for being stopped
or in full-on, providing greater visibility and understanding.

## Restart As

Easily restart an experiment as a feature, or vice versa, to adapt to
evolving project needs seamlessly.

## Customizable Action Dialog Comment Field

Customize the comment field in experiment action dialogs via platform
settings. This enables stricter or more relaxed requirements and provides
better guidance to platform users on writing action comments.

## User Mentions

In preparation for the upcoming official Slack integration, weâ€™ve added
user mentions in the rich text editor using the "@" symbol.

## Latency Improvements

We've achieved more consistent latency for initial context data fetching
from SDKs by implementing Cloudflare's Tiered Caching.

## Maintenance Window

This upgrade is scheduled for **Thursday, May 23rd, between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM GMT**.
There will be no impact on data collection, and any intermittent errors in
the web console during the update will be brief, lasting approximately 10
minutes.

## Feedback & Next Steps

We are committed to continuously improving our platform to meet your
evolving needs and provide you with the best possible experience. Your
feedback is invaluable to us, so please don't hesitate to share your
thoughts or suggestions.
