# July 2024

We are pleased to inform you about the latest updates and improvements to
our platform. Here are the key highlights of this release:

## Enhanced Template Management

We've made it easier to create, manage, and use experiments and feature
flags templates.

## New Permissions System

You now have the ability to assign permissions, allowing you to control
who can create and manage templates. You can also specify who can create
new experiments and feature flags from scratch or from templates.

## Improved Template Navigation

Navigating through templates is now more intuitive, with all
functionalities accessible directly from the left-hand menu.

## Scheduling Capabilities

You can now schedule experiments and feature flags to start in the future.
This is particularly useful if you want to initiate an experiment on a
specific day and time, such as creating an experiment on a Friday
afternoon that begins on Monday morning, allowing you to monitor it for
errors.

## Increased Security

We've improved the overall security of the platform by displaying API Keys
only during their creation. If a key is lost, a new one will need to be
generated.

## Maintenance Window

The update will be implemented on **July 11th, between 2:00 PM & 4:00 PM**.
During this time, there may be a brief period of disruption. We appreciate
your understanding and patience as we work to enhance your experience.

## Feedback & Next Steps

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not
hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your continued support and
cooperation.
