# January 2024

We are thrilled to inform you about an upcoming upgrade to our platform
that will introduce exciting new features to enhance your experience. We
have listened to your feedback and are introducing valuable tools to help
you better analyze your data.

## Achievement Time Filters

You can now filter achievements based on specific time frames, allowing
you to track conversions more accurately by focusing on events that occur
close to the time of exposure.

## Metric Histogram

Visualize the distribution per variant for a particular metric with our new
metric histogram chart, providing valuable insights into the shape of your
data.

## Cancellation and Refund/Replacement Tracking

We are introducing the ability to create metrics that track goals,
cancellations, and refunds/replacements simultaneously, giving you a
comprehensive view of your performance metrics.

## Other Improvements and Bug Fixes

-   Expand action comments easily with a new button for more comfortable
    typing of larger comments.
-   Use JSON mode for audience filter expressions to simplify editing and
    copying of complex expressions.
-   Improved navigation and browsing for variant screenshots and
    activity/comment image attachments.
-   Enhanced user experience with editing experiments now bringing you to
    the origin page when possible.

## Maintenance Windows

We have two interventions scheduled to upgrade and optimize our platform.

The first upgrade is scheduled for
**Thursday, February 1st, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM**.

A second intervention focused on infrastructure optimization will take
place one week later on
**Thursday, February 8th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM**.

During these periods, there will be no impact on data collection. However,
the web console might return some intermittent errors for a short period
(approximately 10 minutes) while we perform the updates.

## Feedback & Next Steps

We appreciate your understanding and are working diligently to minimize any
inconvenience during both upgrade windows. We are confident that these
enhancements, combined with our infrastructure optimization, will
significantly benefit your workflow and data analysis capabilities.
