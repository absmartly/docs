# December 2024

In this December release, we have introduced some exciting new features
and improvements to make your experimentation experience smoother, faster,
and more customizable. Here's what's new:

## Enhanced GST

We made significant usability improvements to our GST to make it easier
and faster to create and monitor experiments.

-   We added up-to-date estimates of each interim analysis so you always
    know when the next analysis will take place.
-   We made it possible to set up a Group Sequential Test by simply using
    a maximum runtime without the need for a MDE.
-   We added a metric's performance graph to help you choose the best
    possible metric and fine tune your experiment setup.
-   We move some fields around on the experiment create form to simplify
    the creation process.

For more details about the new GST improvement check our
[documentation](/docs/web-console-docs/setting-up-a-gst-experiment).

## Fields Locking in templates

We improved our experiment and feature templates by making it possible to
lock some fields so they are no longer editable when creating experiments
or features. This ensures standardized setups and reduces the risk of
errors. For more information on creating and using templates you can read
our [documentation](/docs/web-console-docs/templates).

## Default platform settings

We made it possible to define default values for some of the analysis
fields of your experiment setup. Click on 'Settings > Platform settings'
to open the default analysis setup.

-   Choose which analysis type
    ([Group Sequential of Fixed Horizon](/docs/web-console-docs/type-of-analysis))
    is the default for all new experiments.
-   Specify minimum and default values for confidence and power levels
-   Specify a default MDE for Group Sequential and Fixed Horizon
    experiments.
-   Provide default values for GST fields like time to first analysis,
    analysis intervals & maximum runtime.

The default platform settings will be applied to all new experiments.

## Feedback & Next Steps

product in general.
