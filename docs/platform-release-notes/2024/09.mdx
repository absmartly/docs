# September 2024

We're excited to introduce several significant improvements to help
streamline and enhance your experimentation workflow. At ABsmartly, we
continually refine our platform so you can focus on what matters
most---running impactful experiments and driving revenue-enhancing
decisions.

## Improved Group Sequential Testing (GST) Engine

We've made our unique Group Sequential Testing (GST) faster, more
flexible, and applicable to a broader range of use cases. GST is now the
default method for all new experiments, although you can still select a
fixed horizon analysis if preferred. Additionally, GST can now be used to
test hypotheses where a **decrease in KPIs**---such as lowering
cancellations or minimizing returns---is expected. This update gives your
team more precision and flexibility when validating a wider range of
hypotheses.

## Simplified GST Checkpoints

We've introduced a simpler way to define checkpoint frequencies in GST
experiments, making the process more intuitive. Instead of pre-planning a
set number of checkpoints, experimenters can now choose how frequently
they want to evaluate results, based on daily, weekly, or custom
intervals. This improvement simplifies setup and helps you make quicker,
more accurate decisions.

## More Accurate Participant Estimation

Estimating the number of participants for an experiment can be tricky,
especially when using complex targeting. To help with this, we've
introduced a feature that uses historical data to estimate the number of
eligible participants based on platform, tracking, and audience criteria.
This should provide a better sense of how long an experiment might run and
whether it's worth conducting.

## Slack Integration for Enhanced Collaboration

We're making team collaboration even easier with the introduction of Slack
integration. You can now receive real-time notifications in your Slack
channels when something important happens with your experiments, ensuring
your team can respond swiftly to updates.

## Experiment Snapshots

To help build a repository of insights for future reference, we've
introduced **Experiment Snapshots**. This feature saves a snapshot of the
dataset used to make experimentation decisions, allowing you to review
past decisions and understand what worked, what didn't, and why certain
actions were taken.

Our September updates are designed to make your experimentation process
simpler, more intuitive, and more effective. With enhanced Group
Sequential Testing, more accurate participant estimation, and seamless team
collaboration, we're focused on helping you make faster, smarter
decisions.

## Maintenance Window

The update will take place on **October 3rd, between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM**,
with a brief period of potential disruption. The update should take no
longer than 10 minutes.
