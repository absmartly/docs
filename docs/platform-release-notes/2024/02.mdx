# February 2024

We're excited to announce an upgrade to our platform, featuring several new
features, improvements, and bug fixes designed to enhance your experience.

## Experiment Health Panel

Monitor the health of your experiments with a new panel that displays
checks performed and their last run times.

## Alerts in Activity Tab

Stay informed with new alerts integrated into the activity tab, allowing
for easy tracking and commenting.

## Retention Metric from First Achievement

Customize retention metrics by setting the reference time to be the moment
of the first achievement, providing flexibility in your analysis.

## Segment Filters in Metric Explorer Tab

For better organization, we have relocated segment filters from the
dashboard to the metric explorer tab.

## Enhanced Segmentation Options

-   Source segmentation attributes from the last exposure of a unit.
-   Use more powerful expressions in segment filters, including the OR
    combinator and numeric operators.

## Participants Time Filter

Filter participants based on specific participant time windows for more
targeted analysis.

## Other Improvements and Bug Fixes

-   Improved the retention metric form, allowing the specification of the
    retention period in units other than days.
-   Added the `ExperimentReady` webhook event for more comprehensive event
    tracking.
-   Provided more informative error messages when a user lacks permissions
    for a certain action.
-   Various minor UI fixes for an overall improved user interface.

## Maintenance Window

The upgrade is set for **Thursday, March 7th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM**.
As with previous upgrades, there will be no impact on data collection.
However, the web console might return some intermittent errors for a short
period (approximately 10 minutes) while we perform the update.

## Feedback & Next Steps

Our team is dedicated to ensuring a seamless transition. We appreciate your
understanding and are available to address any questions or concerns you
may have. Thank you for your continued support.
