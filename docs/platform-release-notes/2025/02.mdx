# February 2025

This release focuses on performance improvements, bug fixes, and usability
enhancements based on customer feedback and QA reports. Additionally,
we're excited to introduce the **beta version of our new Velocity Report**,
designed to help you track your experimentation program more effectively.

## Beta Feature: Velocity Report

We're introducing the
[Velocity Report (Beta)](/docs/web-console-docs/Experiment-reports) to
give teams better visibility into experimentation speed and execution
trends. This report helps you understand how efficiently experiments move
through different stages, providing insights to optimize your
experimentation process.

-   **How to enable it?** Your platform admin can turn on the beta version
    of 'Experiment reports' from the platform settings page.
-   **What's next?** We're already working on the next iteration and would
    love your feedback! Is this report useful? What additional insights
    would you like to see on the report? Let us know so we can improve it
    together.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

This release includes **50+ bug fixes and small improvements** reported by
our customers and QA team. Here are some key updates:

-   **Improved Navigation:** You can now **Cmd+Click (Ctrl+Click)** to
    open experiments, metrics, or any other link in a separate tab.
-   **Metric Usability Enhancements:**
    -   Improved **tooltips for metrics** across the platform to provide
        clearer definitions.
    -   Fixed **negative metrics displaying incorrect colors** on the
        Explore tab.
    -   Fixed the **ordering of metrics** on the overview page for a more
        consistent experience.
-   **Experiment Insights:**
    -   Enhanced **recommended action alerts** when experiments are
        completed, making it easier to evaluate results.
    -   Added a **decision snapshot label** on stopped and completed
        experiments so you know which dataset you're looking at.
    -   Made the **GST graph more dynamic**, improving usability when the
        observed effect is large.
-   **Experiment creation:**
    -   Improved **fetching of max participant numbers** for better
        accuracy.
    -   Introduced **data sampling** in metric performance graphs for
        improved platform performance.

These updates enhance platform stability, performance, and usability to
make experimentation even smoother.

## Feedback & Next Steps

Your input is invaluable! If you have thoughts on the
**Velocity Report (Beta)** or any other updates, we'd love to hear from
you.
