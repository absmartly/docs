# May 2025

## Overview  
This release focuses on backend improvements and foundational work to support future features. While there are few visible changes for you today, these updates improve platform stability and pave the way for upcoming capabilities. We still managed to squeeze a few improvements to the Velocity report and to the Experiment Dashboard redesign.

## Velocity Report

- **View the list of experiments:** The most requested feature request for the velocity report. You can now click on any graph on the Velocity Report to get the list of experiments included.
- **Early stop vs Early full-on:** The Experiments not completed graph now shows the breakdown between the early full-on and early stops.

## Experiment Dashboard Redesign

Our new Experiment Dashboard redesign is still in progress and you can see. The main reason behind this redesign is to consolidate how *Fixed Horizon* and *Group Sequential* experiments are shown and to make it easier for everyone to make quality decisions. In this release we added GST data to the metric's table. Please have a look and let us know what you think.

- **How to see it?** Within the dashboard of any existing experiment you will have a *'Load new UI'* button which will enable you to toggle between the old and the new view.
- **Whatâ€™s next?** Give us your feedback below or send it to [support@absmartly.com](mailto:support@absmartly.com).
