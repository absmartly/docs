## New Feature: Team Management (Foundations)

Teams become much more than just metadata, you can now properly define and manage teams within the platform. This update allows you to map your internal organizational structure directly into the product by:

- Creating and managing teams
- Assigning users to teams
- Structuring teams hierarchically (e.g. parent and child teams)

This is the first step toward upcoming improvements around ownership, permissions, and team-level collaboration. Go to `Settings > Teams` to get started with managing your team and inviting your team members. If you already have teams defined in ABsmartly, you can simply move them to the right place in your org structure. Check our [wiki page](/docs/web-console-docs/creating-and-managing-teams) for more information on creating and managing teams in ABsmartly.

## New Feature: One-Click Experiment Data Export

We added an **Export data** button to the experiment overview page, allowing you to export participant exposures and goal event data for that experiment with a single click.

- No need to navigate through events page or APIs
- Directly download all experiment related data with a single click
- Makes it easier for teams to access raw data for custom analysis or deep dives

*From the experiment overview page:*

- Click on `...` and select `Export data`.
- You will get a confirmation that the request is in progress. The process might take a while depending on the size of the experiment.
- You will get a notification on the experiment activity page once the export file is ready.
- The export file will be available for 30 days once it has been created.

Only users with the Events:List permissions will be able to trigger the export and download the file.

## Improved Metrics & Goals List Pages

Finding the right metrics and goals just got easier. We've enhanced the list pages to:

- Improve searchability and filtering (archived vs unarchived)
- Help you quickly identify and select the metrics and goals that matter

## Other Fixes & Improvements

This release also includes several smaller enhancements and bug fixes to improve overall platform stability and performance.
