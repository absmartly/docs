# March 2025

This March release focuses mainly on our reports by improving the
**Velocity Report** and launching the new **Decisions Report**. Both of
those reports will help you get a better overview and track your
experimentation program more effectively.

## Velocity Report updates

In this release we focused on improving the Velocity Report which we launched
in February. Thank you for all the great feedback you sent us (keep it
coming), we tried to address as many of them as possible. Here are some
key updates:

-   **Added Teams and Tags filters:** Being able to report on specific
    teams and filter on tags was the main feedback we received.
-   **Improved Filters usability:** We made it easier to select multiple
    values in the filters.
-   **Unique Experiments toggle:** We replace the old 'Show iterations'
    toggle with a new 'Unique Experiments'. The report now defaults to
    reporting on all experiment iterations.
-   **Not Completed widget:** To make it clear that it includes early Full
    On as well as early stops, we renamed the **Aborted** widget to
    **Not completed**.

## Beta Feature: Decisions Report

After the Velocity Report, we are also excited to launch the second part
of our reports, the
[Decisions Reports (Beta)](/docs/web-console-docs/experiment-reports/#decisions-overview).
While the velocity report focused on the experiments you and your
colleagues run. The decisions report focuses on the decisions you make as
a result of those experiments. Those decisions include ***Full on***,
***Keep current*** and ***Abort***. This report also includes a
**Decisions Timeline**, which makes it easy to quickly browse through
past decisions.

-   **How to enable it?** If you have not enabled reports yet, your
    platform admin can turn on the beta version of 'Experiment reports'
    from the platform settings page.
-   **What's next?** We are already working on some improvements but like
    with the Velocity Report we are very much looking forward to getting
    your feedback on this first release of the Decisions Report so we can
    make it right for you.

## Experiment Dashboard redesign

We are working on a new improved version of one of the most important
parts of the product, the *Experiment Dashboard page* (which we renamed
the Experiment Overview page), and while we did not quite manage to finish
it in time for this release we want to give you a preview of what we are
doing so you can give us some early feedback. The main reason behind this
redesign is to consolidate how *Fixed Horizon* and *Group Sequential*
experiments are shown and to make it easier for everyone to make quality
decisions.

-   **How to see it?** Within the dashboard of any existing experiment you
    will have a *'Load new UI' alert* which will enable you to toggle
    between the old and the new view.
-   **What's next?** Give us your feedback below or send it to
    [support@absmartly.com](mailto:support@absmartly.com).

## Feedback & Next Steps

We want to build the best possible experimentation platform for you so if
you have any thoughts on this release or on any other features please
[let us know](mailto:support@absmartly.com).

In the next few weeks we will start working on improving our
**Feature Flags** capabilities and while we already have a good idea of
which problems we want to solve and which features we want to bring to
you, we want to hear what specific use cases you might have so if you have
specific needs, requirements or wishes make sure to let us know so we can
set some time to have a chat with you.
