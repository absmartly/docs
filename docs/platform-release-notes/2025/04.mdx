## Overview  

In this new release we mainly focused on improvement to the **Velocity **and **Decisions Reports**. All those improvements are driven by feedback we received from you so keep them coming. Here are some of the most important updates.

## Velocity Report

-   **Aggregate data per quarter:** To help you run your quarterly experimentation reports we made it possible to aggregate the data per quarter (previously you could only aggregate per year, month or week).
-   **Aborted reasons report:** We introduced a new Aborted Reasons report. This report breaks down all aborted experiments (experiments stopped early) by their aborted reason which is captured when the experiment is stopped. This new report will make it easier to understand bottlenecks and current issues in your experimentation program.
-   **Experiment completed:** We fixed an issue where we were over-reporting the number of completed experiments.

**Stay tuned**: One of the main feature requests we received for the Velocity Report is to be able to open the list of experiments in each report. We are hoping to introduce this feature in one of our upcoming releases.

## Decisions Report

Earlier this month we launched the new [Decisions Reports (Beta)](/docs/web-console-docs/experiment-reports/#decisions-overview). In this release we are introducing a few improvements to provide better insights into each decision.

-   **Secondary & Guardrail metrics:** Like with the primary metric, you can now see the experiment results on the secondary and guardrail metrics. This helps understand the rationale behind each decision.**
-   **Health checks:** We are now surfacing any [health check violations](/docs/web-console-docs/Experiment-health-checks) in the reports so you can get better insights into the quality of each decision.
