## New Feature: Built-In Notifications  
Never miss a key event again. Our new built-in notification system ensures you're always up to date with what's happening on the platform.

- **Team assignments**: Get notified when you're added to or removed from a team  
- **Experiment/feature lifecycle updates**: Get alerts when an experiment starts, stops, is put Full On, or when a feature is turned on/off.

More alert types will be added in upcoming releases — stay tuned!

## New Feature: Impact per Day Estimates  
We've added new **Impact per Day** estimates to all relevant metric types in the experiment overview to help you better understand the real‑world significance of your experiment results.
This gives you a clearer picture of the **daily impact** your changes could have when rolled out, making it easier to evaluate their practical value.
