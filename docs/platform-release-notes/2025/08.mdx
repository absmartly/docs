## Overview

This release brings several UX improvements and bug fixes aimed at making experimentation and collaboration smoother and more reliable. We’ve made owner management more flexible, improved graph interactions, and fixed key issues around estimations and data tables.

## Improved Owner Filters and Flexibility
Managing ownership is now easier and more consistent across the platform and allowing us to improve in the future who has access to what:
- An owner can now be either a single user or a team
- The Owner field now accepts both single users and teams when filtering, making results more inclusive.

## Bug Fixes and Usability Improvements
A series of fixes ensure the platform behaves more intuitively and reliably, like:
- **MDE and Max Runtime Automatic Estimation Refresh**: Estimates now update automatically when the standard deviation is changed. We also improved our estimation precision.
- **Graph Zoom Behavior**: Y-axis now updates correctly when zooming in, giving you a clearer view of trends.
- **GST Estimate Accuracy**: The next GST analysis estimate now correctly respects the minimum time between analyses.
