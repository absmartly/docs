## The ABsmartly Chrome Extension - The ABsmartly LaunchPad Beta

We made it easier to create experiments using our new ABsmartly LaunchPad. This Chrome Extension makes it possible to create experiments using a simple Visual Editor.
While the Chrome Extension is still in Beta, we encourage you to give it a try.

Before you get started see our guides on [getting started with the LaunchPad](/docs/LaunchPad%20Browser%20Extension/getting-started-with-the-launchpad) and [creating your first experiment](/docs/LaunchPad%20Browser%20Extension/creating-an-experiment-with-the-launchpad).

## Ownership & Permissions model - Sharing of Assets

In this release we make it possible to share **experiments**, **features**, **templates**, **goals** and **metrics** with users and teams so they collaborate and make use of those assets.

This was the last building block in our Ownership & Permission model. Some changes will be necessary on your side before you can fully make use of this new model.
We encourage you to read our [how-to guide](/docs/ownership-and-permissions) and to reach out to us if necessary so we can jump on a call and guide you through those changes.

We want to make things better and future proof for you. We realise that we introduced a lot of changes but unless you take action on all the action items described above 
then nothing should change (except for the Team Ownership which is now the default but which can be disabled in your settings) and you will be able to keep using the platform like you use it today.

When you are ready to start making use of the new functionalities, let us know and if you need help for example with some of the steps described above.

## Improved experiment search list

We've improved the filters on the experiments list to make it easier to find what you are looking for and to align with how experiments are filtered on the velocity reports. 
Here is a list of the changes we made to the search filters:

- Added a new `Type` filter so you can differentiate between `experiment` and `full on` instances. You can now easily find running or stopped experiment without seeing the full on instances.
- Added `Completed`, `Not Completed` and `Aborted` to the `State` filter to align with how experiments are filtered on the velocity reports.
- Removed `Running - Not full on` from the `State` filter, as you can now find running experiments by selecting `experiment` in the `Type` filter.
- Renamed the `Significance` filter to `Result` and changed it values to `Insignificant`, `Negative`, `Positive` to avoid confusion about the states and statistical significance of the experiments 

## Data Retention Update  

We are continuing our work in improving efficiency
