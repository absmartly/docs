## Overview  

This new release is packed with new features and improvements to help you manage your experiemntation program and make it easier to create simple experiments without the need for developers

---
## The ABsmartly Chrome Extension - The ABsmartly LaunchPad Beta

We made it easier to create simple experiments using our new **ABsmartly LaunchPad**. This Chrome Extension makes it possible to create experiments using our new Visual Editor and without the need for developers.
While the Chrome Extension is still in Beta, we encourage you to give it a try and give us feedback. 

Before you get started see our guides on [getting started with the LaunchPad](/docs/LaunchPad%20Browser%20Extension/getting-started-with-the-launchpad) and [creating your first experiment](/docs/LaunchPad%20Browser%20Extension/creating-an-experiment-with-the-launchpad).

You can also watch this video where Jonas takes you through the process of creating a simple experiment.

This first release is only the first step as we have big plans for the **ABsmartly LaunchPad** in 2026.

## Ownership & Permissions model - Sharing of Assets

In this release we make it possible to share **experiments**, **features**, **templates**, **goals** and **metrics** with users and teams so they collaborate and make use of those assets.
This feature makes it easier for teams to collaborate without having to share ownership of the asset.

This was the last building block in our Ownership & Permission model. Some changes will be necessary on your side before you can fully make use of this new model.
We encourage you to read our [how-to guide](/docs/web-console-docs/ownership-and-permissions) and to reach out to us if necessary so we can jump on a call and guide you through those changes.

We want to make things better and future proof for you. We realise that we introduced a lot of changes but unless you take action on all the action items described above 
then nothing should change (except for the Team Ownership which is now the default but which can be disabled in your settings) and you will be able to keep using the platform like you use it today.

When you are ready to start making use of the new functionalities, let us know and if you need help for example with some of the steps described above.

## Improved experiment search list

We've improved the filters on the experiments list to make it easier to find what you are looking for and to align with how experiments are filtered on the `Velocity Report`. 
Here is a list of the changes we made to the search filters & search list:

- Added a new `Type` filter so you can differentiate between `experiment` and `full on` instances. You can now easily find running or stopped experiment without seeing the full on instances.
- Added `Completed`, `Not Completed` and `Aborted` to the `State` filter to align with how experiments are filtered on the velocity reports.
- Removed `Running - Not full on` from the `State` filter, as you can now find running experiments by selecting `experiment` in the `Type` filter.
- Renamed the `Significance` filter to `Result` and changed it values to `Insignificant`, `Negative`, `Positive` to avoid confusion about the states and statistical significance of the experiments 
- Fixed the issue where reporting on the impact of GST experiments was not correct on the experiment list.
- Fixed an issue so the color of the impact of inconclusive experiments is gray as on the experiment's overview page.

## Data Retention Update  

As part of our ongoing work on performance and cost optimisation we are planning to introduce the following data retention rules in a future update : 
- **1 year retention for experiment goal and exposure data**. While experiment results will always remain available and visible, this change means
that you won't be able to explore metrics and to slice and dice data for experiments which are stopped for 1 year or more.
- **30 days retention for unused exposure data**. Exposure events which are not linked to any actual experiment will be deleted after 30 days.

Do you think this will impact you? If yes, get in touch so we understand your need for this data.
