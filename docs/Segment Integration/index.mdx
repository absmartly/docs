# Segment Integration

This is a Lambda function that runs on [Segment](https://www.segment.com)
for A/B Smartly Integration.

It extracts the relevant data from Segment events and sends it, correctly
formatted, to the A/B Smartly Collector endpoint.

It can also be added directly as a destination function on a Segment workspace.

### Configuring a Workspace Destination Function

If you are configuring a destination function on your workspace, these are the necessary settings:

| Name                        | Type    | Required | Javascript                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Advanced Usage

### Sending experiment exposures to Segment

It can be useful to send experiment exposures to Segment for visibility from
other destinations. The Segment spec includes the [`Experiment Viewed`
semantic event](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/ab-testing/)
for this purpose.

In the A/B Smartly context, we can
[install a custom event logger](https://docs.absmartly.com/docs/sdk%20documentation/getting-started/#using-a-custom-event-logger)
and send exposures directly to Segment.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{JsSendingExposuresToSegment}</CodeBlock>

### Mapping Segment Identities to A/B Smartly Units

For simple mappings, you can map Segment's identities/properties
to A/B Smartly's units in your A/B Smartly integration settings in Segment.

If you want to programmatically make this mapping, you can install a
middleware in your Segment SDK that will append the units to the
`properties.absmartly.units` field before sending to Segment.
The destination function will extract and use that instead. This may be
useful if you are running A/B Smartly experiment on units that are not
the typical Segment `anonymousId` or `userId`.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{JsMappingSegmentIdentitiesToUnits}</CodeBlock>

### Publishing Experiment Exposures Through Segment

To publish experiment exposures, you must turn on `EnableExposureTracking`
in your destination settings in Segment.

We want to replace the direct flow of exposure events from the A/B
Smartly SDK to the A/B Smartly collector, by instead sending them to Segment
for processing by the destination function.

This can be achieved by instantiating the A/B Smartly SDK with a custom
context publisher.

The custom publisher will publish an `Experiment Viewed` Segment event
with A/B Smartly's exposure data in the `properties.absmartly` field as well
as the normal semantic data that Segment recommends for this event.

Here is an example in Javascript.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
  {JsPublishingExposuresThroughSegment}
</CodeBlock>

You should now have your A/B Smartly Segment integration fully set up!
