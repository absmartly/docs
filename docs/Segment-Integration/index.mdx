# Segment Integration

This is a Lambda function that runs on [Segment](https://www.segment.com)
for ABsmartly Integration.

It extracts the relevant data from Segment events and sends it, correctly
formatted, to the ABsmartly Collector endpoint.

It can also be added directly as a destination function on a Segment workspace.

## Configuring a Workspace Destination Function

If you are configuring a destination function on your workspace, these are the necessary settings:

### Collector Endpoint

- **Type:** String
- **Required:** &#9989
- **Javascript:** `settings.collectorEndpoint`

Your dedicated ABsmartly Collector Endpoint. Example: `https://demo.absmartly.io/v1`

### API Key

- **Type:** String
- **Required:** &#9989
- **Javascript:** `settings.apiKey`

API Key to use when sending events to the ABsmartly Collector. API Keys are
created in the ABsmartly Web Console's Settings section.

### Environment

- **Type:** String
- **Required:** &#9989
- **Javascript:** `settings.environment`

The environment name where the events are originating (case sensitive).
Environments are created in the ABsmartly Web Console's Settings section.

### Unit Mapping

- **Type:** Mapping
- **Required:** &#9989
- **Javascript:** `settings.unitMapping`

Mapping of Segment identity to ABsmartly Unit. Mapping of Segment identity
to ABsmartly Unit. Example `anonymousId` -> `anonymous_uuid`, `userId` ->
`user_id`. Units are created in the ABsmartly Web Console's Settings section.

:::note
This mapping is required, even if the names are exactly the same.
:::

### EnableExposureTracking

- **Type:** Boolean
- **Required:** &#10060
- **Javascript:** `settings.enableExposureTracking`

Enable sending ABsmartly exposures to the ABsmartly Collector.

:::note
Enable this **only** if you instantiate the ABsmartly SDK with a **custom**
publisher and are sending ABsmartly exposures through Segment.
:::

### EnablePageViewTracking

- **Type:** Boolean
- **Required:** &#10060
- **Javascript:** `settings.enablePageViewTracking`

Enable sending Segment's
[Page events](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/page/) as goals to
the ABsmartly Collector.

:::caution
These events tend to happen very frequently and may increase storage cost.
:::

:::note
The goal generated will have the name `Page: <Page Name>` for example
`Page: Home` and needs to have been previously created in
the ABsmartly Web Console's Settings section.
:::

### EnableAppScreenViewTracking

- **Type:** Boolean
- **Required:** &#10060
- **Javascript:** `settings.enableAppScreenViewTracking`

Enable sending Segment's
[Screen events](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/screen/) as goals
to the ABsmartly Collector.

:::caution
These events tend to happen very frequently and may increase storage cost.
:::

:::note
The goal generated will have the name `Screen: <Screen Name>` for example
`Screen: Login` and needs to have been previously created in the ABsmartly
Web Console's Settings section.
:::

### Goal Mapping

- **Type:** Mapping
- **Required:** &#10060
- **Javascript:** `settings.goalMapping`

Mapping of Segment event names to ABsmartly goal names. If a mapping exists,
it will be used, otherwise the original event name will be used as the goal
name.

## Advanced Usage

### Sending experiment exposures to Segment

It can be useful to send experiment exposures to Segment for visibility from
other destinations. The Segment spec includes the [`Experiment Viewed`
semantic event](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/ab-testing/)
for this purpose.

In the ABsmartly context, we can
[install a custom event logger](https://docs.absmartly.com/docs/sdk-documentation/getting-started/#using-a-custom-event-logger)
and send exposures directly to Segment.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{JsSendingExposuresToSegment}</CodeBlock>

### Mapping Segment Identities to ABsmartly Units

For simple mappings, you can map Segment's identities/properties
to ABsmartly's units in your ABsmartly integration settings in Segment.

If you want to programmatically make this mapping, you can install a
middleware in your Segment SDK that will append the units to the
`properties.absmartly.units` field before sending to Segment.
The destination function will extract and use that instead. This may be
useful if you are running ABsmartly experiment on units that are not
the typical Segment `anonymousId` or `userId`.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{JsMappingSegmentIdentitiesToUnits}</CodeBlock>

### Publishing Experiment Exposures Through Segment

To publish experiment exposures, you must turn on `EnableExposureTracking`
in your destination settings in Segment.

We want to replace the direct flow of exposure events from the ABsmartly SDK to the ABsmartly collector, by instead sending them to Segment
for processing by the destination function.

This can be achieved by instantiating the ABsmartly SDK with a custom
context publisher.

The custom publisher will publish an `Experiment Viewed` Segment event
with ABsmartly's exposure data in the `properties.absmartly` field as well
as the normal semantic data that Segment recommends for this event.

Here is an example in Javascript.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
  {JsPublishingExposuresThroughSegment}
</CodeBlock>

You should now have your ABsmartly Segment integration fully set up!
