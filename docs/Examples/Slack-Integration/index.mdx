# Custom Slack Integration

:::note
If you are looking for the official Slack integration check [here](/docs/Third-party-integrations/Slack-Integration)
:::

This article will walk you through creating a custom Slack integration for your ABsmartly Web Console.
The integration will be a NodeJS [Express](https://expressjs.com/) app that sends notifications about experiment events
to a Slack channel of your choice.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Check out a starter integration on [our **examples** GitHub repository](https://github.com/absmartly/examples/tree/main/Javascript/slack-integration).

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14+)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [ABsmartly Web Console](https://www.absmartly.com/) account with admin access

## Create a Node Project

First, we will create a new NodeJS project using npm. In your terminal, run:
```bash title="Terminal"
mkdir absmartly-slack-integration
cd absmartly-slack-integration
npm init -y
```

### Install dependencies
Next, we will install the dependencies we need for our express app:
```bash title="Terminal"
npm i express body-parser dotenv axios
npm i -D typescript ts-node nodemon @types/node @types/express @types/body-parser @types/axios
```
and create a `tsconfig.json` file:
```bash title="Terminal"
npx tsconfig.json # Choose node
```
Inside your `tsconfig.json`, add a `rootDir` compiler option, like so:
```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "src",
    "outDir": "dist",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Create Initial Express App
Create a `src` folder and add an `index.ts` file:
```bash title="Terminal"
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```
Inside the `index.ts` file we will start with a simple Express app.
```typescript title='src/index.ts'
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import "dotenv/config";

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  res.status(200).send("OK");
})

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}`);
})
```
This code simply listens on port 3000 and logs the body of any POST request to the console. To run it, let's add some
scripts to our `package.json` file:
```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rm -rf dist && tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon --watch 'src/**/*.ts' --exec 'ts-node' src/index.ts"
  },
  ...
}
```
Now we can run our express app with `npm run dev` and in a separate terminal window, send a POST request to it:
```bash title="Terminal"
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"Hello World!"}' http://localhost:3000
```
You should see the message logged in the terminal window where the express app is running.

## Create a Slack App

To hook up our express app to Slack, we will need to create a Slack App that can accept incoming webhooks.
A tutorial for how to set this up can be found [here](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

Once you have a Slack Webhook URL, we can continue with the guide!

### Sending a Message to Slack

Create a `.env` file and add your Slack Webhook URL to it:

```env title=".env"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

We will now send a message to Slack to make sure everything is working. Add the following code to
the top of your `index.ts` file:

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
const SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL || "";

const postToSlack = async (message: Record<string, unknown>) => {
  return await axios.post(SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, message);
};
```

and change your `app.listen()` function to:

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}`);
  postToSlack({
    text: "Hello from the ABsmartly Slack integration!",
  });
});
```

Start your app with:
```bash title="Terminal"
npm run dev
```

And you should see a message appear in your Slack channel!

## Commit Your Changes

To deploy our Express app, we will be using [Render.com](https://render.com/). The simplest way to get started is to
[create a repo on GitHub](https://github.com/new) and push our code to it.

First, go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository, then follow the instructions to push your code:

```bash title="Terminal"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Deploying Your Express App

Now our code is online, we can deploy our initial Express app. For this guide we will be using the free service,
[Render.com](https://render.com/), but feel free to use any service that you like!

### Setting up Render

[Create a render account](https://render.com) and create a new web service. Choose NodeJS as the type, connect your
Github account and select your repository from the list.

For the build script, input
```bash title="Render Build Command"
npm install && npm run build
```
and for the start command:
```bash title="Render Start Command"
npm start
```

Click on Save and your express app should start building and deploying, but you won't receive a message in Slack yet.

First, head to your render service's settings and click on the Environment tab. Add your Slack webhook URL as an environment variable.
Make sure to have the same name as in your `.env` file, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.

Render should automatically redeploy your app with the new environment variable and a message should appear in your Slack channel.

## Creating a Webhook in ABsmartly

Now that we have our express app deployed, we can create a webhook in ABsmartly.

Go to https://your-company-name.absmartly.com/settings/webhooks and create a new webhook.

For the name, enter `Slack Integration` and for the URL, enter the URL of your express app https://your-service.onrender.com.

We are going to make sure our webhook is `Enabled` and `Ordered`; we will give it 3 max retries;
and we will choose to send events whenever any experiment event occurs.

This includes:
- [ExperimentCreated](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-created)
- [ExperimentDevelopment](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-started-in-development)
- [ExperimentStarted](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-started)
- [ExperimentStopped](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-stopped)
- [ExperimentRestarted](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-restarted)
- [ExperimentFullOn](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-put-full-on)
- [ExperimentEdited](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-edited)
- [ExperimentCommented](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-commented-on)
- [ExperimentArchived](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-archived)
- [ExperimentUnarchived](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-unarchived)
- [ExperimentAlertCreated](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#experiment-alert-created)

Click `Create Webhook` and we should start receiving events in our express app!

## Sending ABsmartly Events to Slack

Our app is now receiving events from ABsmartly, but we are only running `console.log()` on the event data
(have a look at your Render logs to see this in action).

Let's send these events to Slack!

In your index.ts file, add the following function:

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
const handleEvent = (event: Record<string, unknown>) => {
    console.log(event);

    const eventName = event.event_name as string;

    postToSlack({
        text: `Event: ${eventName}`,
    })
}
```
and change your `app.post()` function to:
```typescript title="src/index.ts"
app.post("/", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        req.body.events.forEach(handleEvent);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }

    res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```
Don't forget to remove your test message from the `app.listen()` function!
```typescript title="src/index.ts"
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Now, whenever an experiment is changed or has an alert created, that event will be sent as a message to your Slack channel!

For further formatting of the messages, checkout the [various Webhook Payloads](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#payloads) that ABsmartly can send, and
have a look at Slack's [Message Formatting](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing) documentation.

Our final `index.ts` file should look like this:

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import axios from "axios";
import "dotenv/config";

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL || "";

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

const postToSlack = async (message: Record<string, unknown>) => {
  return await axios.post(SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, message);
};

const handleEvent = (event: Record<string, unknown>) => {
  console.log(event);

  const eventName = event.event_name as string;

  postToSlack({
    text: `Event: ${eventName}`,
  });
};

app.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    req.body.events.forEach(handleEvent);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }

  res.status(200).send("OK");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Next Steps

Our [example Slack integration repo](https://github.com/absmartly/examples/tree/main/Javascript/slack-integration) goes
quite a bit further by pulling experiment and user data from both the ABsmartly Web Console and the Slack API to enrich
the messages that are being sent. Feel free to fork it and use it as a starting point for your own integration!
