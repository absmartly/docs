# Basic Usage

After the init call, all the variants for all running experiments will be
cached in memory. The init call should take a single-digit number of milliseconds on the
server side. On the client side, it may take a little longer (itâ€™s another
roundtrip to the server) unless you pass the data directly in the HTML which
makes it ready immediately. Any experiment that is evaluated and is not
running will return Variant 0 (the control group).
