#### Config API

If you use configuration files to change different aspects of your
application, then you can use the Config API to greatly improve your workflow and
save a lot of coding time.

<CodeBlock language="js">{JsMergeConfig}</CodeBlock>

##### Basic Example

Let's say you use a configuration file to change various parameters in your
application:

<CodeBlock title=".../src/homepageConfig.js" language="js">
  {JsConfigParameters}
</CodeBlock>

Then you could use the Config API to run experiments that change those parameters.

Imagine you start two experiments:

- **button_color**
  - _Control group_ variables = `{ button.color: "blue" }`
  - _Variant 1_ variables = `{ button.color: "green" }`
- **homepage_cta**
  - _Control group_ variables = `{ button.cta: "Click me", hero_image: "https://cdn.com/img1.png" }`
  - _Variant 1_ Variables = `{ button.cta: "Click here", hero_image: "https://cdn.com/img2.jpg" }`

For each user the SDK receives a payload similar to this:

<!--Must be in file, due to raw-loader json bug-->

```json
{
  "guid": "dhsUiLJ7xgQBEbivw_0cjiKo9O6UlnSg",
  "units": [],
  "assignments": [
    {
      "name": "button_color",
      "variant": 1,
      "config": {
        "button.color": "green"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "homepage_cta",
      "variant": 0,
      "config": {
        "button.cta": "Click here",
        "hero_image": "http://cdn.com/img1.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This user is in _Variant 1_ of the **button_color** experiment and in the _
control group_ for the **homepage_cta** experiment. Calling
`context.mergeConfig(cfg)` from the Javascript SDK would return a config
object like this:

<CodeBlock language="js">{JsReturnedConfig}</CodeBlock>

:::info notice
When the config API is used, you don't need to call the `treatment()` method.
It will be called automatically when keys from the config are used.
:::

So you can continue using your configuration file as you were before, but
now, the correct experiments will be triggered when a value is being
overridden by said experiment.

This greatly simplifies the process of setting up experiments and cleaning up
your code. If, at somepoint, a large part of the code is setup in this way
you will be able to create different experiments without touching a single
line of code.

##### Translations Example

Let's look at a slightly more complex example where you have to run an experiment
whilst accomodating for multiple languages.

Here, we have a languagesConfig.js file:

<CodeBlock language="js" title=".../src/languagesConfig.js">
  {JsLanguagesConfig}
</CodeBlock>

In our code, we can then get all of our variant variables using:

<CodeBlock language="js">{JsGetVariantVariableKeys}</CodeBlock>

The `translationVariations` variable would then be returned as something like:

```json
{
  "header_v1": {
    "en": "Our beautiful header!",
    "nl": "Onze mooie kop!"
  },
  "call_to_action1_v1": {
    "en": "Continue",
    "nl": "Doorgaan"
  }
}
```

...which you could then merge with your original translations, like so:

<CodeBlock language="js">{JsMergeTranslationConfigs}</CodeBlock>

...which would return an object similar to:

```js
{
    get header: () => {
      exp.treatment("experiment1");
      return {
        en: "Our beautiful header!",
        nl: "Onze mooie kop!",
      };
    }
    get call_to_action1: () => {
      exp.treatment("experiment2");
      return {
        en: "Click here!",
        nl: "Klik Hier"
      };
    }
}
```

You can now use this object to run your experiments whilst still supporting multiple
languages!
