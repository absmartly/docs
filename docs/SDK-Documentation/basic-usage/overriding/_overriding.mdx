### Overriding Based On URL Params

The most common use case for overriding is to override a treatment based on
params in the URL. This allows for greater flexibility in the development and 
QA stages. The following Javascript function can be ported to any language and
used to parse the URL query parameters and return an object of overrides. This
object can then be passed to the `overrides()` context method to force a particular
variant for one or multiple experiment(s).

:::info Prefixes
Here we using `absmartly_` as a prefix for the query parameters, but you can 
use whatever prefix you like. It could be `exp_`, `test_`, or even a simple `_`!
:::

```js
function getABsmartlyOverridesFromQuery(req) {
  const overrides = {};

  // Iterate through all query parameters
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(req.query)) {
    // Check if the query parameter starts with "absmartly_"
    if (key.startsWith('absmartly_')) {
      // Extract the experiment name (remove "absmartly_" prefix)
      const experimentName = key.slice(9);

      // Convert the value to a number if possible, otherwise keep it as a string
      const variantValue = isNaN(value) ? value : Number(value);

      // Add to overrides object
      overrides[experimentName] = variantValue;
    }
  }

  return overrides;
}
```
