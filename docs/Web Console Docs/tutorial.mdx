# Getting Started

Welcome to your Web Console dashboard! This is where you will create, view and monitor
your experiments.

You're almost ready to start [creating your first experiment](creating-an-experiment)!
But first we have to tell the dashboard **how**, **where** and **why** you want to run
your tests.

## Creating A Unit

Units are the unique identifiers that are going to be used to generate a variant.
For experiments running across different platforms (iOS, Android, web, email, etc.) the
unit should be known across all of them. Most likely the authenticated
user's `user_id`.

Have a look at the [Tracking Unit](/docs/Web%20Console%20Docs/creating-an-experiment#tracking-unit)
section of the **Creating an Experiment** docs for more information.

To define your first Unit go to `Settings > Units` and click on `Create Unit`.
All that needs set here is the name of your unit. We recommend that you give
it the same name as it's referenced in your code.

:::info Tip
Feel free to add a description, so the rest of your team knows **what** the unit
will reference to and **why** it exists.
:::

## Setting Your Applications

When creating an experiment, you will be asked which platforms the experiment
will run on.

To set these up, navigate to `Settings > Applications` and click `Create Application`.

Similarly to Units, you can name these whatever you want and add a description
to define it more for your team. Some examples of application names might be
`ios`, `android` or `www`.

Once your applications are defined, you're ready to move on to...

## Setting Your Goals

Goals are the names given to processes that you will later track in your code.

To setup your first goal, head to `Settings > Goals` and click on `Create Goal`.

The goal name will be used in your code, so we recommend using a keyword-like
or kebab-case name. For example, `newsletter_subscription`, `cpu_load_time` or
`bookings`.

:::info Tip
[Tags](settings#tags) are useful for searching, filtering and classifying your
goals. We recommend prefixing each tag with the tag's type. For example,
`location:Header`, `stack:Backend` or `psychological:Trust`.
:::

## Creating A Metric

Lastly, you will need to creat some Metrics! Metrics are the parameters that
will be used to track your goals. They can give you insights about your
business, your users' behavior, the performance of your system and more!

To create a metric, head to `Settings > Metrics` and click on `Create Metric`.

Each metric needs a name. Some examples of metrics trackable metrics
might be `Bookers`, `Bookings` or `Time to Book`. You can also give your
metric a description for clarity across your team.

### Metric Impact

Next, you need to choose your metric's impact. For this, you have three choices -
positive, negative or unknown.

|                                                                                    Positive                                                                                     |                                                                           Negative                                                                            |                                                                                                                    Unknown                                                                                                                    |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| A metric with a positive impact means that if it is increased, it's good for your business. For example, `Bookings`, `Revenue` and `Subscribers` would all be positive metrics. | Metrics with a negative impact, on the other hand, are bad for business if they increase in frequency. For example, `Unsubscriptions` or `Account Deletions`. | Metrics with an unknown impact are used when the effect of the metric could be either positive or negative. For example, `Time on Page` could be positive or negative depending on whether the user is engaged, versus whether they are lost. |

### Metric Type

Next up is the metric's type. There are 4 types to choose from:

#### Goal Unique Count

`Goal Unique Count` is used when you want to automatically track the amount
of unique users [(units)](#units) who performed a goal. `Bookers` is a good
example of this as you want to track the amount of people who booked, not the
total amount of bookings. For that you would choose...

#### Goal Count

`Goal Count` is used for when you want to track every instance of a goal being
achieved. `Bookings` is a good example for this one, as a single user may
have made multiple bookings.

#### Goal Time to Achievement

`Goal Time to Achievement` is the amount of time between the user being
exposed to your experiment and achieving a goal. This is tracked
automatically by all of our SDKs.

#### Goal Property

`Goal Property` is used when you want to use your own properties for tracking
a metric. For example, you may wish to track the `Revenue` made during your
experiment. This will be done by passing the revenue as a property when tracking
your goal. For example, in the Javascript SDK it would look like this:

```js
context.track("goal_name", { revenue: 99.99 });
```

Selecting `Goal Property` in the Metric Type field adds some extra fields to
the form. You can learn more about these in the
[goal property fields section](#goal-property-fields).

### Metric Goal

The `Metric Goal` is the goal which your metric relates to. This field will
provide a dropdown of any goals that you set up in the [Setting Your Goals section](#3-setting-your-goals).

### Goal Property Fields

If your metric is of `Goal Property` type, you will have to fill in some
extra information on where the property value will come from and how you want
it to be formatted on the dashboard.

Upon selection, you will be presented with 4 more fields.

#### Source Property

This field defines where the property value comes from in your track call.
For example, if you were to call the track method in your code with the
following parameters:

```js
context.track("revenue", {
  payment: {
    provider: "paypal",
    revenue: 99.99,
    currency: "USD",
  },
});
```

And you want to use the revenue made as your metric's source property, you
would pass `payment/revenue` into the Source Property field.

#### Format String

The format string defines how you would like your values to be presented in
the Web Console. The curly braces `{}` represent the value and you can put
whatever you like around it. For example, if you wanted to track your
incoming revenue in dollars, you might want your Format String to be `${}`.
This would cause a value of `1000` to be presented on the dashboard as `$1000`.

Below the Formatting fields, you can see a preview of how your value will be
formatted.

#### Scale of Value

The scale of value is a multiplier for your value. This is useful if,
for example, your revenue is tracked in cents. You could set the metric's
scale of value to `0.01` and a revenue value of `100000` cents would show itself
as `$1000`.

#### Precision

The precision option allows you to set a number of decimal places that your
value can have. Set this to `2` and a revenue value of `1000.455` will be
presented as `$1000.46`.

### Property Filters

Property Filters allow you to filter your metrics to make them more specific.
Let's take our example `track` call from earlier:

```js
context.track("revenue", {
  payment: {
    provider: "paypal",
    revenue: 99.99,
    currency: "USD",
  },
});
```

If you are tracking your revenue, you may want to limit the metric to amounts
that were paid in dollars. This can be done by adding a property filter where
`payment/currency` - `Is` - `USD`. Now, only amounts paid in dollars will be
tracked by this metric.

:::info NOTE
In this use-case, you might want to rename the metric to `Revenue in Dollars`.

## The Next Step

Now you have your units, applications, goals and metrics set up, you're ready to move
on to the next chapter - [creating an experiment](creating-an-experiment)!
