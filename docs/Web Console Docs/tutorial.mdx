# Getting Started

Welcome to your Web Console dashboard! This is where you will create, view and monitor
your experiments.

You're almost ready to start [creating your first experiment](creating-an-experiment)!
But first we have to tell the dashboard **how**, **where** and **why** you want to run
your tests.

## 1. Creating A Unit

Units are the unique identifiers that are going to be used to generate a variant.
For experiments running across different platforms (iOS, Android, web, email, etc.) the
unit should be known across all of them. Most likely the authenticated
user's `user_id`.

Have a look at the [Tracking Unit](/docs/Web%20Console%20Docs/creating-an-experiment#tracking-unit)
section of the **Creating an Experiment** docs for more information.

To define your first Unit go to `Settings > Units` and click on `Create Unit`.
All that needs set here is the name of your unit. We recommend that you give
it the same name as it's referenced in your code.

:::info Tip
Feel free to add a description, so the rest of your team knows **what** the unit
will reference to and **why** it exists.
:::

## 2. Setting Your Applications

When creating an experiment, you will be asked which platforms the experiment
will run on.

To set these up, navigate to `Settings > Applications` and click `Create Application`.

Similarly to Units, you can name these whatever you want and add a description
to define it more for your team. Some examples of application names might be
`ios`, `android` or `www`.

Once your applications are defined, you're ready to move on to...

## 3. Setting Your Goals

Goals can be used to give you insights about your business, your users'
behavior, the performance of your system and more!

To setup your first goal, head to `Settings > Goals` and click on `Create Goal`.

Each goal starts with a name and an impact. The goal name will be used in your
code so we recommend using a keyword-like or kebab-case name. For example,
`newsletter_subscription`, `cpu_load_time` or `bookings`.

:::info Tip
[Tags](settings#tags) are useful for searching, filtering and classifying your
goals. We recommend prefixing each tag with the tag's type. For example,
`location:Header`, `stack:Backend` or `psychological:Trust`.
:::

Next, you need to give your goal an impact. For this, you have three choices -
positive, negative or unknown.

|                                                                                        Positive                                                                                         |                                                                         Negative                                                                         |                                                                                                                  Unknown                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| A goal with a positive impact means that if it is increased, it's good for your business. For example, `booking`, `checkout` and `subscribing` would all be positively impacting goals. | Goals with a negative impact, on the other hand, are bad for business if they increase in frequency. For example, `unsubscribing` or `deleting_account`. | Goals with an unknown impact are used when the effect of the goal could be either positive or negative. For example, `time_on_page` could be positive or negative depending on whether the user is engaged, versus whether they are lost. |

### Metrics

Metrics are a reference to the actual data that is being tracked. Three metrics are tracked by default per goal:

|                   Conversion Rate                    |                                     Achievements                                      |                                  Time to Achieve Goal                                   |
| :--------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| How many users [(units)](#units) achieved this goal. | How many times those units achieved the goal. Some might have done it more than once. | The time between the units being exposed to the experiment and the goal being achieved. |

:::note

[dashboard settings documentation](settings.mdx#metrics).

Now you have your units, applications and goals set up, you're ready to move
on to the next chapter - [creating an experiment](creating-an-experiment)!
