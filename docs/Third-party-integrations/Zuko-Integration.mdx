[Zuko](https://zuko.io) is a leading form analytics platform that helps you understand how users 
interact with your forms. This guide will show you how to integrate ABsmartly experiments with 
Zuko to gain deeper insights into how your experiments affect your forms.

## Prerequisites

1. **ABsmartly Implementation:** Ensure ABsmartly is correctly implemented on your page. Refer 
    to the [SDK documentation](/docs/APIs-and-SDKs/SDK-Documentation/getting-started) for more information.
2. **Zuko Account and Tracking:** [Create a Zuko account](https://app.zuko.io/signup) (if 
    you don't have one) and ensure that the tracking is successfully added to your form. Refer to 
    the [Zuko Installation Guides](https://www.zuko.io/guides) for more information.

## Implement the JS snippet

Add the following JavaScript function to your page, preferably in a `<script>` tag within the 
`<head>` section or in a separate JavaScript file that's loaded before your Zuko tracking code. 
This function extracts experiment and variant information from the ABsmartly context and sets them
as Zuko attributes.

```js
ABsmartlyContext.ready()
    .then(() => {
        const context = ABsmartlyContext;

        window.zuko = window.zuko || {};
        window.zuko.attributes = window.zuko.attributes || {};

        for (const experiment of context.data()?.experiments) {
            const name = experiment.name;
            const variant = context.peek(name);

            window.zuko.attributes[`exp_${name}`] = variant;

            if (experiment.variants?.[variant]?.name) {
                window.zuko.attributes[`variant_${experiment.variants[variant].name}`] = variant;
            }
        }
        console.log("Zuko attributes set:", window.zuko.attributes);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error initializing ABsmartly context:", error);
    });
```

The `exp_YourExperimentName` and `variant_YourVariantName` can be changed - this is simply how 
this will appear in Zuko under the filter drop down menu. We are just adding the experiments as 
attributes into `window.zuko.attributes`. See [Zuko's documentation on setting custom attributes](https://www.zuko.io/guides/using-custom-attributes).

## Verify the integration

1. **Run your experiment:** Make sure your experiment is running on ABsmartly and users are being assigned to 
    different variants.
2. **Submit test forms:** Fill out the forms on your page while participating in the test. You can do this for
    different variants using the ABsmartly SDKs' [override functionalities](/docs/APIs-and-SDKs/SDK-Documentation/basic-usage#overriding-treatment-variants).
3. **Check Zuko:** Go to your Zuko dashboard and look for the custom attributes you configured in the 
    filters dropdown. You should see attributes like `exp_YourExperimentName` with values corresponding 
    to the assigned variant for each form submission. It might take a few minutes for the data to appear in Zuko.

If you have any issues setting up the Zuko integration then please contact us on [support@absmartly.com](mailto:support@absmartly.com),
