# SDK Documentation

This guide provides detailed information about A/B Smartly’s SDKs. We
currently support Javascript, Swift, VueJS &amp; Java.

Have a look at [our Github](https://github.com/absmartly/) to see our current
SDKs and those which are still in development (here's looking at **you** Ruby
developers)!

## Getting Started

This guide assumes that you are already partnered with us and your Web Console
has been setup by our team. If you are looking to start your experimentation
journey, [request a demo](https://absmartly.com/quiz) with one of our
teammembers!

### Install the SDK

<Install />

### Import and Initialize the SDK

<ImportAndInitialize />

### Create a New Context Request

<CreateNewContextRequest />

## Basic Usage

After the init call, all the variants for all running experiments will be
cached in memory. The init call should take a single-digit number of milliseconds on the
server side. On the client side, it may take a little longer (it’s another
roundtrip to the server) unless you pass the data directly in the HTML which
makes it ready immediately. Any experiment that is evaluated and is not
running will return Variant 0 (the control group).

### Selecting a Treatment
