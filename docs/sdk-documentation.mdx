# SDK Documentation

This guide provides detailed information about A/B Smartly’s SDKs. We
currently support Javascript, Swift, VueJS &amp; Java.

Have a look at [our Github](https://github.com/absmartly/) to see our current
SDKs and those which are still in development (here's looking at **you** Ruby
developers)!

---

## Getting Started

This guide assumes that you are already partnered with us and your Web Console
has been setup by our team. If you are looking to start your experimentation
journey, [request a demo](https://absmartly.com/quiz) with one of our
teammembers!

### Install the SDK

<Install />

### Import and Initialize the SDK

<ImportAndInitialize />

### Create a New Context Request

<CreateNewContextRequest />

### Set Context Attributes

<SettingContextAttributes />

## Basic Usage

After the init call, all the variants for all running experiments will be
cached in memory. The init call should take a single-digit number of milliseconds on the
server side. On the client side, it may take a little longer (it’s another
roundtrip to the server) unless you pass the data directly in the HTML which
makes it ready immediately. Any experiment that is evaluated and is not
running will return Variant 0 (the control group).

### Selecting a Treatment

### Treatment Variables

## Config API

### Basic Example

### Translations Example

## Publish

## Finalize

<Finalize />

## Attributes

To create audiences (target based on specific conditions) you need to pass
custom attributes to the SDK, before making the `context.treatment()` call. This can
be done using the method `context.attributes()` or by passing an `attributes` parameter
in the SDK initialization. It’s common to use a mix of both methods. Many
attributes of the user and/or request are known from the beginning and can be
passed at initialization, others may depend on information only known later in
the request.

The attributes are compared and evaluated against the attributes used in the
Web console to verify that the right conditions were added to the code.
If the SDK fails to match the conditions in the code with the conditions used
in the Web console, users with a mismatch will still be exposed to the
experiment unless `enforce_audiences: true` is passed to the SDK at
initialization. Otherwise you’ll see a warning in the console to let you know
that the conditions in the code don’t match the audience that you were
planning to target.
In the example below, we are rolling out an experiment to users that are
logged in, using the website in English, bought an item with a price greater
than $100 and are a returning customer.

:::note Only available for Js-SDK
Unfortunately, this feature is only available on the Javascript SDK for now.
If you require it elsewhere,
please <a href="mailto:cal@absmartly.com">contact one of our teammembers</a>.

<Attributes />

:::caution
You should create an audience with the exact same attributes in the Web console.
By default it will not enforce those conditions, but if for some reason the
`context.treatment()` method is called for a user that doesn’t meet this criteria, the
Web console will warn you about it. This means that you either didn’t specify
your audience correctly in the Web console, or you have a bug in your
triggering condition.
