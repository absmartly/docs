# Overview

The APIs & SDKs section provides everything you need to integrate ABsmartly into your product.  
This is the technical foundation that powers experiment assignment, event tracking, feature flags and consistent user experiences across all platforms.

Here you will find:
- SDK documentation for client side, server side and mobile environments  
- API references for the ABsmartly platform and the SDKs  
- implementation guides, examples and best practices  
- details on exposure handling, goal tracking and variant assignment  

If you are an engineer integrating ABsmartly or maintaining experiment infrastructure, this section is for you.  
It explains how the SDKs work, how to use the API programmatically and how to build a reliable experimentation setup that fits your architecture.
