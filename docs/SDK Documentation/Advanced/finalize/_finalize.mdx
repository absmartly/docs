Call the `context.finalize()` method before letting a process using the SDK exit, as
this method gracefully shuts down the SDK by clearing caches, and closing
connections. It will also call `context.publish()` to flush the remaining
unpublished impressions.

<CodeBlock language="js">{JsFinalize}</CodeBlock>

:::caution
After `finalize()` is called and finishes, any subsequent invocations to the
`treatment()` method will still return the right variant, but will result in a
warning to let you know that you might be losing impressions.
