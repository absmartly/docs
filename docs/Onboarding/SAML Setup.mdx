# SAML SSO With Okta

The ABsmartly Web Console supports SAML SSO with Okta. This guide will walk you through the steps to get it set up!

## Configuring Okta

In Okta, login as an administrator and ensure that you are in the Classic UI.

Once there, expand the Application menu on the left and click on Applications. Once there,
click the Create App Integration button.

### Create a SAML Application

Choose **SAML 2.0** as the Sign on method and click `Next`.

Provide an **App name** and click `Next`.

It can be added to the Okta integration by clicking on the **Upload Logo** button and selecting the downloaded image.

In the SAML Settings section, paste your provided SSO url into the **Single sign on URL** field and set the
**Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** field to `absmartly`. The **Name ID format** should be set to `EmailAddress`,
the **Application username** should be set to `Email` and **Update application username on**
should be set to `Create and update`.

:::info
Your SSO url will be provided by ABsmartly, but it usually takes the form of:
```
https://<your-company-name>.absmartly.com/auth/saml/okta/callback
```
:::

In the Attribute Statements section, click `Add Another` and add the following attributes:
- `firstName` - `Basic` with a value of `user.firstName`
- `lastName` - `Basic` with a value of `user.lastName`
- `department` - `Basic` with a value of `user.department`

We use these attributes to set up each user's name and department in ABsmartly. Click the `Next` button.

### Add Users to your SSO Integration

After the previous step, you will be redirected to the `Sign on` tab of your newly created SAML application. Click on
the `Assignments` tab to start defining who can sign in with Okta. Click on `Assign` and either `Assign to People` or
`Assign to Groups` depending on your needs.

## Sending Us The Integration Metadata

Once you have completed the previous steps, you will need to send us the integration metadata. To do this, click on the
`Sign on` tab of your newly created SAML application and scroll down to the SAML Signing Certificates section.

Click the actions button next to your most recently created Signing Certificate and select `View IdP metadata`.

You will be brought to a page with your metadata as an XML file. Simply copy the URL of this page and send it to us
through Slack or email.

Once we have received your metadata your employees will be able to sign in to ABsmartly using Okta!
