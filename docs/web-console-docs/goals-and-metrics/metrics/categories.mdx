# Metrics Categories

## Overview

Metric category is a label that groups related metrics, so teams can find, compare, and report on them consistently across experiments. 
It helps users understand the intent of a metric at a glance, standardizes dashboards and filters, and improves governance by keeping similar measures together.

Use a category to describe what a metric is about, not how it is calculated. 

## Create & Manage

You can create and manage Metrics Categories by going to `Settings` and clicking on `Metric Categories`.
