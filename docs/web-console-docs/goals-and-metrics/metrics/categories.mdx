# Metrics Categories

## Overview

Metric category is a label that groups related metrics, so teams can find, compare, and report on them consistently across experiments. 
It helps users understand the intent of a metric at a glance, standardizes dashboards and filters, and improves governance by keeping similar measures together.

Use a category to describe what a metric is about, it can represent direct business outcomes, engagement signals, or technical performance indicators.

Frequently used categories include `conversion`, `engagement`, `retention`, `revenue`, etc but feel free to create and manage categories that best suit your needs.

## Create & Manage

You can create and manage Metrics Categories by going to `Settings` and clicking on `Metric Categories`.
