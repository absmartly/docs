# Overview

## Experimentation Metrics

Metrics are aggregations or computations derived from [goals](../goals/overview). 
They transform raw event data into interpretable measures that quantify the effect of an experiment. 
Metrics summarize performance over a group of experiment visitors — for example, `conversion rate`, `Average revenue per visitor`, or `click-through rate`. 
Metrics can represent direct business outcomes, engagement signals, or technical performance indicators, 
and are often grouped into [categories](categories) such as `conversion`, `engagement`, `retention`, or `revenue`.
