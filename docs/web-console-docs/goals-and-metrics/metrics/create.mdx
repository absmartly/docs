# Create a new Metric

To create a new metric, navigate to the Metric's catalog and click on `Create metric`

## Global Settings

| Field | Description | 
|-------|--------------|
| **Metric name** | This name of the metric must be unique across the entire platform. |
| **Owners**| The list of team and individual owners for this metric. |

:::info
Metric's global settings are shared across all versions of a metric. 
Future changes to those fields will apply to all existing and future versions of a metric.

## Details & Metadata

The Metric detail and Metadata sections provide some advanced information about the metric.
This information is version-specific and, as such, can differ between different versions of the same metric.

| Field | Description | 
|-------|--------------|
| **Description** | Providing a good description is important as it helps experiments choose the right metric.|
| **Impact**| Directionality of the metric. `positive` means that increasing this metric is good. `negative` means that decreasing the metric is good. Use `unknown` if the metric has no preferred direction.|
| **Metric type**| Describes how the metric is implemented. Choose between [`count`](metric-types/goal-count), [`goal unique count`](metric-types/goal-unique-count), [`ratio`](metric-types/ratio), [`property`](metric-types/property), [`retention`](metric-types/retention), [`time to achievement`](metric-types/time-to-achievement) and [`unique property count`](metric-types/unique-property-count). See the Metric Types pages for more details on each type. |
| **Tags** (optional)| Makes the metric more discoverable by providing relevant [tags](/docs/web-console-docs/configuration/settings#tags).|
| **Category** (optional)| The [category](categories) the metric belongs to (`conversion`, `performance`, etc). While optional, selecting a category makes it easier for experimenters to find relevant metrics. |
| **Applications** (optional)| Select the [applications](../../configuration/applications) where this metric makes sense. Only experiments running on these applications should track this metric. While optional, setting the correct `Application(s)` helps experimenters find relevant metrics for their experiments. |
| **Units** (optional)| Select the [tracking units](../../configuration/units) for which this metric is computed. The tracking unit of the metric should match the tracking unit of the experiments where it is tracked. While optional, setting the correct `Tracking Unit(s)` will help experimenters track relevant metrics in their experiments. |

## Goal

In this section you can select and configure the [goal](../goals/overview) which provides the raw data for this metric. 

```javascript
// Triggered when a visitor buys a product
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 99.99,
  currency: 'euro',
  order_number: '0000982532',
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: 'ZYZ123'
});
```

### Goal

Select the [goal](../goals/overview) to use as a source for this metric. 
In the example above, the name of the goal is `purchase`. 

If you don't see a goal in the list, make sure it exists and make sure you have the correct permissions to view and use it.

:::info
Auto-created goals do not have an owner when created. For governance reasons, make sure to claim ownership of a goal before you start using it for your metric.

### Property

In the case of [`Property`](metric-types/property) or [`Unique Property Count`](metric-types/unique-property-count) metrics,
you also need to choose which property of the metric to use.
For example, a `revenue` metric built using the goal event above, would use the event property **price**. 

### Property filters

Property filters let you include only the goal events whose properties match specific conditions.
These filters apply to the properties inside the event payload.
With the example above, we might want to create a `conversion` metric but only for product of a certain category, 
in that case a **category_id** property filter can be used to filter only the relevent **purchases** events.

From that event, we could also create a `revenue (euro)` metric by filtering events by **currency**.

### Time filters

Every visitor becomes exposed to an experiment at a specific moment. We call it the **first-seen** event. 
That timestamp is the reference point for all time-based filters.

A time filter lets you include only the goal events that happen within a defined window after that first exposure. 
This ensures your metric measures behavior in a controlled, meaningful period (for example, “purchases within the first hour” or “engagement in the first 7 days”).

### Outliers

Outlier limits help control the influence of extreme metric values. 
They reduce noise and variance by capping or removing values that sit outside a defined range. 
When calculating a metric based on a property such as **price** in our example, you can choose one of four methods to manage outliers:

::: warning: Use Outlier Limits Carefully
Outlier limits can reduce variance and make metrics more stable, but they also change the underlying data. 
When used incorrectly, they may hide meaningful effects or introduce bias in experiment results. 
Always ensure your limits reflect real-world constraints rather than engineering convenience, and avoid tuning them in response to specific experiment outcomes. 
:::

#### Unlimited

This is the default. This option applies no outlier treatment. All values are kept exactly as they appear in the event data.
Use this option when you want full fidelity of raw data and are not concerned about extreme values skewing results.

#### Quantile

This method filters values based on chosen quantiles. 
You define a lower quantile and an upper quantile (for example, 0.05 and 0.95). 
Values below the lower quantile or above the upper quantile are excluded.

How it behaves with the sample purchase event:
```
If you set:

- Lower quantile: `0.05`
- Upper quantile: `0.95`

Then:

- If `1000` falls between the 5th and 95th percentile of all purchase prices, it is kept.
- If `1000` is higher than the 95th percentile (for example if most prices are between 10 and 300), it is **removed from the data**.
```

Quantile filtering is useful when your data contains long tails or rare extreme highs.

#### Standard Deviation

This method caps values based on the mean and standard deviation of all observed values. 
You enter multipliers that determine how far from the mean the lower and upper limits should be.

The limits are calculated as:

```
- Lower limit: mean − (stdev × lower multiplier)
- Upper limit: mean + (stdev × upper multiplier)
```

Any value outside these limits is **removed from the data**.

Example with the sample purchase event:
Suppose across all purchases:

```
- mean price = 200
- standard deviation = 150

If you set:
- Lower multiplier = 1
- Upper multiplier = 2

Then:
- Lower limit = 200 − (150 × 1) = 50
- Upper limit = 200 + (150 × 2) = 500

Our event's price:
- 1000 > 500 → it is excluded.

Both limits equal the mean.
This effectively disables trimming on one side depending on the multiplier:

- Lower multiplier 0 → lower limit = mean → keeps all values below the mean
- Upper multiplier 0 → upper limit = mean → keeps all values above the mean

Setting both to 0 is the equivalent of setting no outlier limit.
```

Standard deviation limits are helpful when extreme values are several standard deviations from the average.

####Fixed

This option lets you define explicit numeric boundaries. Any value below the lower limit or above the upper limit is removed.

Example with the sample purchase event:

```
- Lower limit value: −1000
- Upper limit value: 1000

Then:
- price = 1000 → exactly at the upper limit → kept

If you change to:
- Lower limit value: 0
- Upper limit value: 500

Then:
- price = 1000 → above 500 → excluded
```

Fixed limits are useful when you already know the acceptable bounds for your metric (e.g., price can never be negative or above a business-defined maximum).
