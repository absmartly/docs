## Details & Metadata

The Metric detail and Metadata sections provide some advanced information about the metric.
This information is version-specific and as such can differ between different versions of the same metric.

| Field | Description | 
|-------|--------------|
| **Description** | The metric's description. Providing a good description is important as it helps experiment choose the right metric.|
| **Impact**| Directionality of the metric. `positive` means that increasing this metric is good. `negative` means that decreasing the metric is good. Use `unknown` if the metric has no preferred direction.|
| **Metric type**| Describes how the metric is implemented. Choose between [`count`](metric-types/goal-count), [`goal unique count`](metric-types/goal-unique-count), [`ratio`](metric-types/ratio), [`property`](metric-types/property), [`retention`](metric-types/retention), [`time to achievement`](metric-types/time-to-achievement) and [`unique property count`](metric-types/unique-property-count). See the Metric Types pages for more details on each type. |
| **Tags** (optional)| Makes the metric more discoverable by providing relevant [tags](/docs/web-console-docs/configuration/settings#tags).|
| **Category** (optional)| The [category](categories) the metric belongs to. Choosing the right category makes it easier for experiment to find relevant metrics. |
| **Applications** (optional)| Select the [applications](../../configuration/applications) where this metric makes sense. Only experiments running on these application should track this metric. |
| **Units** (optional)| Select the [tracking units](../../configuration/units) for which this metric is relevant & computed. |
