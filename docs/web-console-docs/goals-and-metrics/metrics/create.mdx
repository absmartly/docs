# Create a new Metric

To create a new metric, navigate to the Metric's catalog and click on `Create metric`

## Global Settings

| Field | Description | 
|-------|--------------|
| **Metric name** | This name of the metric must be unique across the entire platform. |
| **Owners**| The list of team and individual owners for this metric. |

:::info
Metric's global settings are shared across all versions of a metric. 
Future changes to those fields will apply to all existing and future version of a metric.

## Details & Metadata

The Metric detail and Metadata sections provide some advanced information about the metric.
This information is version-specific and, as such, can differ between different versions of the same metric.

| Field | Description | 
|-------|--------------|
| **Description** | Providing a good description is important as it helps experiments choose the right metric.|
| **Impact**| Directionality of the metric. `positive` means that increasing this metric is good. `negative` means that decreasing the metric is good. Use `unknown` if the metric has no preferred direction.|
| **Metric type**| Describes how the metric is implemented. Choose between [`count`](metric-types/goal-count), [`goal unique count`](metric-types/goal-unique-count), [`ratio`](metric-types/ratio), [`property`](metric-types/property), [`retention`](metric-types/retention), [`time to achievement`](metric-types/time-to-achievement) and [`unique property count`](metric-types/unique-property-count). See the Metric Types pages for more details on each type. |
| **Tags** (optional)| Makes the metric more discoverable by providing relevant [tags](/docs/web-console-docs/configuration/settings#tags).|
| **Category** (optional)| The [category](categories) the metric belongs to. While optional, selecting a category makes it easier for experimenters to find relevant metrics. |
| **Applications** (optional)| Select the [applications](../../configuration/applications) where this metric makes sense. Only experiments running on these applications should track this metric. While optional setting the correct **Application(s)** helps experimenters find relevant metrics for their experiments. |
| **Units** (optional)| Select the [tracking units](../../configuration/units) for which this metric is computed. The tracking unit of the metric should match the tracking unit of the experiments where it is tracked. While optional setting the correct **Tracking Unit(s)** will help experimenters track relevant metrics in their experiments. |

## Goal

In this section you can select and configure the [goal](../goals/overview) which provides the raw data for this metric. 

```javascript
// Triggered when a visitor buys a product
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  currency: 'euro',
  order_number: '0000982532',
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: 'ZYZ123'
});
```

### Goal

Select the [goal](../goals/overview) to use as a source for this metric. 
In the example above, the name of the goal is `purchase`. 

If you don't see a goal in the list, make sure it exist and make sure you have the correct permissions to view and use it.

:::warning
Auto-created goals do not have an owner. For governance reasons, make sure to claim ownership of a goal before you start using it for your metric.
:::

## Property

In the case of [`Property`](metric-types/property) or [`Unique Property Count`](metric-types/unique-property-count) metrics, you also need to choose which property of the metric to use.

```javascript
// Triggered when a visitor buys a product
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  currency: 'euro',
  order_number: '0000982532',
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: 'ZYZ123'
});
```
