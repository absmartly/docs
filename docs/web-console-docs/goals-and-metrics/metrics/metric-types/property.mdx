# Property

## Overview

Aggregates a numerical value included in the event payload, such as price, quantity, or duration.

## Examples

```javascript

context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  order_number: "0000982532",
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: "ZYZ123"
});

```

A common example is `Revenue`, which would sum the `price` for all `purchase` events.

## Good to know

- Essential for money- or quantity-based metrics.
- Sensitive to outliers; clipping or CUPED may help.
