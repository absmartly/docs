# Unique Property Count

## Overview

Counts how many unique values of a specific property appear in the goal events triggered by users.
Instead of counting users, this metric measures the variety or diversity within a property, such as the number of different products purchased, 
the number of distinct categories reached, etc.

This metric helps you understand breadth rather than volume or frequency.

## Examples

```javascript
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  order_number: "0000982532",
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: "ZYZ123"
});
```

From this event, a `Unique products purchased` metric could be created by selecting the **product_id** property.

## Good to know

- Great for understanding variety, breadth, and coverage within your goals.
- Useful for marketplaces, catalog browsing, search, merchandising, and content variety analyses.
- Each property value is counted once, regardless of how many times it appears.
- Filtering the goal event first (e.g., to a category or price range) affects which values contribute to the unique count.
- Outlier settings do not apply here since the metric counts distinct strings or identifiers, not numeric values.
- Can complement total count or user-based metrics by revealing diversity even when volume is stable.
