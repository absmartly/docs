# Goal Count

## Overview

Counts how many times a specific goal event is triggered, even if the same user fires it multiple times.

## Examples

```javascript
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  order_number: "0000982532",
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: "ZYZ123"
});
```

Given a `purchase` event shown above, a `Total purchases` metric could be created. 
This metric would simply **count all the purchased** made by visitors.

Using a metric's filter it is also possible to create `Total purchases Category ZYZ123` from such events.
In this case, the metric would count all the purchase of product from category ZYZ123.

## Good to know

What you need to know about `Goal Count` metrics. 

- Good for measuring total activity volume.
- Simple to understand and compute.
- Can be skewed by heavy users who trigger the event repeatedly.
