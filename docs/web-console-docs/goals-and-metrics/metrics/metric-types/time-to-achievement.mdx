# Time to Achievement

## Overview

Measures how long it takes a user to reach a specific goal after entering an experiment.

## Examples

```javascript

context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  order_number: "0000982532",
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: "ZYZ123"
});

```

A possible `Time to Achievement` metric create from this event could be `Time to first purchase`.

## Good to know

- Great for understanding friction and delays in the user journey.
- Can be skewed by users who never reach the goal.
- Can have a very long tail.
