# Goal Unique Count

## Overview

Counts how many unique users triggered a goal event at least once.

## Examples

```javascript

context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  order_number: "0000982532",
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: "ZYZ123"
});

```

From this event, a `Unique purchasers` metric could be created.
This metric counts how many distinct users triggered the purchase event, regardless of how many times they purchased.

A filtered version such as `Unique purchasers (Category ZYZ123)` would count only users who purchased from category ZYZ123.

## Good to know

- Great for conversion-style metrics.
- More stable than total counts since each user counts once.
- Does not capture purchase volume per user.
