# Ratio

## Overview

A Ratio metric compares two related metrics by dividing one value (the numerator) by another (the denominator).
This creates a normalized measure that reveals the relationship between the two quantities rather than their absolute values.

Ratio metrics are useful when you want to understand efficiency, conversion, quality, or per-user averages, because they remove scale effects and highlight how one metric behaves relative to another.

## Examples

Suppose you track the following events:

```javascript
context.track("click", {
  element: "add_to_cart",
  product_id: "ABC123"
});

context.track("page_view", {
  page: "product_detail",
  product_id: "ABC123"
});
```

You could build a `Click-through rate ratio` metric defined as:
- **Numerator**: `Clicks per visitor`
- **Denominator**: `Page views per visitor`

This produces a meaningful relative measure that answers:
“Out of all page views, how often do users click the add-to-cart button?”

More examples:
- `Average revenue per order`
-- Numerator: Revenue
-- Denominator: Orders

- `Purchases per active session`
-- Numerator: Purchase count
-- Denominator: Session count

- `Errors per request` (for performance / reliability metrics)
-- Numerator: Error events
-- Denominator: API requests

- `Unique products purchased per purchaser`
-- Numerator: Goal Property Unique Count (product_id)
-- Denominator: Unique purchasers

In all cases, the ratio reveals relative performance rather than total scale.

## Good to know

- Ratio metrics are derived metrics: they depend on two other existing metrics.
- They allow you to normalize behaviors across traffic volumes, user counts, or content types.
- Fluctuations in either numerator or denominator can change the ratio — interpreting ratios requires understanding both sides.
- They are highly effective for comparing efficiency (e.g., clicks per page view), value (e.g., revenue per user), or quality (e.g., errors per request).
- Outlier settings, goal filters, and definitions of numerator and denominator are inherited from their underlying metrics.
- A ratio metric does not directly count events — instead, it evaluates the relationship between two already-defined metrics.
- Changes to numerator or denominator definitions typically require versioning, since a ratio metric’s meaning depends entirely on those definitions.
