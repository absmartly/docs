# Retention

## Overview

A `Goal Retention` metric measures how many users return to complete a goal again after a defined period of time.
It tells you whether users continue performing the same action after a delay, rather than only measuring their initial behavior.

You can track retention either:

- from the moment a user is first exposed to the experiment, or
- from the moment the user first completes the goal itself

This makes it possible to measure longer-term engagement and whether your experiment influences users’ likelihood to come back and repeat an action.

## Examples

```javascript
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  order_number: "0000982532",
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: "ZYZ123"
});
```

Imagine you want to measure how many users who first purchased **make another purchase within 7 days**.

You can create a `Purchase Retention (7 days)` metric by:
- Selecting the `purchase` goal
- Setting the `Retention Period` to 7 days
- Choosing whether the retention window starts from:
    - the user's first exposure, or
    - the user's first purchase

Then the metric counts users who satisfy:
- they completed the initial purchase
- and they completed another purchase after 7 days, within the configured retention window

**More examples**

- `Checkout Recovery (24 hours)`:
Users who returned to complete a purchase within 24 hours after first adding to cart.

- `Content Return (3 days)`:
Users who read an article again within 3 days after their first reading.

- `Subscription Renewal (30 days)`:
Users who returned to perform a renewal action after a 30-day cycle

## Good to know

- Great for measuring long-term impact rather than immediate conversions.
- Helps identify behaviors such as repeat purchases, content revisits, subscription renewals, or delayed engagement.
- The metric counts users, not events — a user either meets retention criteria or does not.
- Filters on the goal event apply before evaluating retention (for example: “retention among users who purchased category ZYZ123”).
- Retention metrics are often more stable and less noisy than total repeated activations, since each user contributes at most once.
- Changing the retention period alters the meaning of the metric and will requires a new version.
- Useful for experiments where the impact is delayed: onboarding experiences, notifications, emails, recommendations, reminders, etc.
