| Field | Description | 
|-------|--------------|
| **Goal Name** | The unique goal name. This is the name which needs to be used in when calling `track` |
| **Description**| Describes what this goal tracks. |
| **Owners**| The list of goal owners. Owners can be Teams or individuals. |
| **Tags**| Tags used to better describe the goal and improve discoverability. |

:::tip
Tags are useful for searching, filtering and classifying your goals. 
We recommend prefixing each tag with the tag's type. For example, location:Header, stack:Backend or psychological:Trust.

## Auto-create

Goals can be created automatically when a [goal event](/docs/web-console-docs/events/goal-events) with a new goal name is processed by ABsmartly. 

:::info
The feature must be enabled for your goals to be auto-created. When in doubt, reach out to ABsmartly Support.
:::

:::warning
Auto-created goals do not have an owner. For governance reasons, make sure to claim ownership of a goal before you start using it.
