# Overview

## Goals

`Goals` capture the fundamental events that occur during an experiment. 
They represent actions that are meaningful to the product or business — such as viewing a page, clicking a button, adding an item to a cart, or completing a purchase. 
Each goal is defined by a name and any associated contextual data (for example, `product ID`, `price`, or `category`). 
Goals are the building blocks of measurement: they define what to observe in the experiment. 
Goals are the raw data used to compute [Metrics](../metrics/overview).

## Goal Events

For a `goal` to be registered in ABsmartly, an event must be triggered by calling the `track` function from the SDK.

```javascript
// Triggered when a visitor buys a product
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  currency: 'euro',
  order_number: '0000982532',
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: 'ZYZ123'
});
```

In the example above, a `goal` with the name **purchase** was triggered.
To learn more about `events` you can read the dedicated [Goal Events page](../../events/goal-events) in the knowledge base.


## Ownership & permissions

`goals` (like `Experiments`, `Features`, `Metrics` & `Templates`) are Managed-Assets and, as such, have a specific [ownership model](/docs/web-console-docs/users-teams-permissions/ownership-and-permissions)

### Ownership

A goal can owned by 1 or more teams and, if the feature was enable for your organisation, individual users.

:::info
Team ownership is generally a better fit for governance because it creates stability, resilience, and accountability at the right level.

A team persists even when individuals change roles, leave, or shift priorities, so the goal keeps a reliable steward over time. 
Expertise is usually distributed across a group rather than held by one person, which reduces risks from single-point knowledge and avoids bottlenecks. 
Team ownership is better suited to review changes, ensure consistency, and maintain quality.
:::

:::warning
Auto-created `goals` do not have an owner when created. 
For governance reasons, make sure to claim ownership of a goal before you start using it.
:::

### Permissions

The following permissions exist when managing and working with `goals`.

| Permission | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Admin goals** | Grants full administrative control over goals, including managing permissions, visibility, and configuration settings for all goals within the workspace or team. |
| **Archive a goal** | Allows archiving a goal that is no longer in use, removing it from active lists while keeping its history for reference. |
| **Create a goal** | Enables the creation of new goals by defining event names, parameters, and associated metadata. |
| **Edit a goal** | Allows modification of existing goal definitions, such as updating the event name, description, or metadata. |
| **Get a goal** | Permits viewing the details of a specific goal, including its configuration and usage across experiments or metrics. |
| **List goals** | Grants access to view the list of all available goals within the workspace or team. |
| **Unarchive a goal** | Allows restoring a previously archived goal, making it active and available for use again. |


#### Global access

Permission to create and manage `goals` can be granted to the relevant users through their [role](../../configuration/settings#roles) at the platform level.

:::info
It is not recommended to provide access to `goals` at the platform level. 
:::

#### built-in team level roles

Permission to create and manage `goals` can be provided to the relevant users at the team level by granting them the correct role in that team.

| Permission | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Team Admin** | Grants full control over goals owned by that team. |
| **Team Contributor** | Grant ability to create and to manage goals in the team scope. |
| **Team Viewer** | Grant ability to view and list Goals owned by the team. |

:::info
Team roles are inherited, so if a user is a `Team Contributor` in a team then this user would also be a `Team Contributor` in all child teams.
:::

### Sharing goals

While `goals` are owned by teams, they can be shared with other teams and individual across the organisation.

| Permission | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **can_view** | Grants this user or team the ability to view and use this goal.   |
| **can_edit** | Grant this user or team the ability to contribute to this goal. |
