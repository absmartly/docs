# Overview

## Goals

Goals capture the fundamental events that occur during an experiment. 
They represent actions that are meaningful to the product or business — such as viewing a page, clicking a button, adding an item to a cart, or completing a purchase. 
Each goal is defined by a name and any associated contextual data (for example, `product ID`, `price`, or `category`). 
Goals are the building blocks of measurement: they define what to observe in the experiment. 
Goals are the raw data used to compute [Metrics](../metrics/overview).

## Goal Events

For a goal to be registered in ABsmartly, an event must be triggered by calling the `track` function from the SDK.

```javascript
// Triggered when a visitor buys a product
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  currency: 'euro',
  order_number: '0000982532',
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: 'ZYZ123'
});
```

In the example above, a goal with the name **purchase** was triggered.
To learn more about events you can read the dedicated page [Goal Events page](../../events/goal-events) in the knowledge base.
