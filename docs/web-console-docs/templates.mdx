# Creating and Using Templates

## Introduction
**Templates** are designed to streamline the process of creating experiments and feature flags. By using templates, you can quickly set up experiments with pre-configured settings, avoiding the need to start from scratch each time. This not only speeds up the process but also ensures consistency and quality across all experiments and feature flags.

## Benefits of using templates
- **Speed**: Create experiments and feature flags faster by using pre-configured and approved settings.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplify the process by eliminating the need for all users to understand the more technical aspects of the experiment setup.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all experiments and feature flags follow a standardized setup, improving overall quality and alignment.

## Permissions

### Permissions for creating and managing templates
Permissions to create, edit, and archive templates can be granted to certain roles. To grant permissions to create and manage templates:
- Navigate to **Settings > Roles** and edit the role you want to grant the permissions to.
- In the list of permissions, open **Template** and select the actions you want the role to be able to perform.

### Creating experiments or feature flags from scratch or from templates
Roles can be granted the ability to create experiments or feature flags either from scratch or from templates:
- Navigate to **Settings > Roles** and edit the role you want to grant the permissions to.
- In the list of permissions, open **Experiment** (note that experiment permissions also apply to feature flags) and select **Create** if you want the role to be able to create experiments or feature flags from scratch and from templates, or choose **Create from template** (and make sure **Create** is not selected) to allow this particular role to only create new experiments or feature flags from a template.

## Getting started with templates

### Creating a new experiment template
If your role has the relevant permission, you should have a **Templates** entry in the menu.
- Click on the **Templates** menu item.
- Click on **+ Experiment template**.
- Fill in the pre-configured values: Go over each page of the experiment template form and set up the pre-configured values for the experiments you want to create from this template. Note that certain fields, like the experiment name, are not editable in the template.
- **Save Template**: Click the **Save Template** button and give the template a name and a description.

### Creating a new feature flag template
If your role has the relevant permission, you should have a **Templates** entry in the menu.
- Click on the **Templates** menu item.
- Click on **+ Features template**.
- Follow the steps described above for creating an experiment template.

## Managing templates

### Editing or archiving a template
Note that only roles with the relevant permissions can manage templates.
- **View Templates**: In the menu bar, click on the **Templates** menu item and on **All**.
- **Edit/Archive a Template**: Choose the template you want to manage and click on **Edit** or **Archive** depending on the action you want to perform.
- **Rename a Template**: Follow the steps above to edit a template, then click on **Save Template**. You can then choose a new name for your template.

## Using a template to create a new experiment
- In the menu, click on **Experiments**.
- Click on **+ Create from template**.
- Choose a template from the list of available templates.
- **Customize as Needed**: Although the template provides pre-configured settings, you can customize any specific details to fit the current experiment.

## Using a template to create a new feature flag
- In the menu, click on **Features**.
- Click on **+ Create from template**.
- Choose a template from the list of available templates.
- **Customize as Needed**: Although the template provides pre-configured settings, you can customize any specific details to fit the current feature flag.

## Locking fields in templates
Template owners have the possibility to lock some fields so they are not editable when the template is used to create an experiment or a feature.
For example if you want all experiments using a template to use a 90% confidence level
- When editing the template, navigate to Step 5
- Set the confidence level to 90%
- Click on the small lock icon next to the label

<Image img="experiment-create/locking-confidence-level.png" alt="Locking the confidence level at 90%" />

The field is no longer editable and all children experimemts will have a pre-set 90% confidence level.

## FAQs

### What happens if I need to change the settings of an experiment created from a template?
You can customize any specific settings of the experiment created from a template. The template provides a starting point, but all settings are adjustable to fit your current needs.

### What happens if a template changes after it is used in an experiment?
Changes will only apply to experiments which have not yet been started (ie: draft ). Running/Stopped/Fullon experiments will not be impacted by the changes to their parent template.
