# Units

Units are the unique identifiers for the visitors, they are used to track those visitors over time and across your [applications](applications). 
Units are also referred as tracking identifiers.

For experiments running across different platforms (iOS, Android, web, email, etc.) the unit should be known across all the platforms. 
Most likely the authenticated user's user-id. 

For experiments running in apps or parts of the website where the user is not authenticated, you might want to create a unit by device.
anonymous-id or device-id are common names for those.

For experiments running in email newsletters, you could even have a unit based on the user's email address, 
but if you are interested in collecting metrics tracked in the website that the newsletter is linking to, 
it's better to use the same unit that is being used for the experiments running in the website.

Have a look at the [Tracking Unit](/docs/web-console-docs/creating-an-experiment#tracking-unit)
section of the **Creating an Experiment** docs for more information.
