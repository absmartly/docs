# Creating and managing teams

Manage your organisation's structure by creating teams, assigning users, and setting up hierarchical relationships between teams. 
Teams help isolate access to content and provide a more relevant experience for users in large organisations.

## Creating a team

To create a new team:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Teams**.
2. Click the **Create team** button in the top right.
3. In the form:
   - **Team name**: Enter a unique name for the team.
   - **Initials**: Customise the abbreviation shown in the team tree and content owned by the team.
   - **Colour**: Pick a colour to help visually distinguish this team.
   - **Parent team**: Choose where this team belongs in the organisational hierarchy.
     - Teams can have only **one parent**.
     - Teams are all children of the top-level team representing your organisation.
   - **Team focus and mission**: Describe what the team does.

4. Click **Create team** to add the team to the hierarchy.

You must have the relevant permissions (`Team admin` or `Team create`) to create a team.

## Managing team members

From a team's detail page:

1. Use the **Add** button in the "Members" section to add users to the team.
2. Search for a user by name or email and click to add them.
3. Added users become **direct members** of the selected team.

### Implicit membership

Users assigned to a team are also **implicitly members of all its parent teams**. 
This allows parent teams to automatically include members from all their child teams.

- Implicit members are shown with the label `Inherited member`.
- You cannot remove implicit members from a parent team — you must remove them from their direct team instead.

## Editing or archiving teams

To update a team:

- Click **Edit** in the team’s detail view to change its name, description, or initials.

To archive a team:

- Click the `...` menu in the team card and select **Archive**.
- Confirm the action in the modal. Archived teams are hidden from the team hierarchy by default.
- The top-level team representing the entire organisation cannot be archived.

2. Click the `...` menu and select **Move**.
3. Choose a new parent from the dropdown list.
4. Confirm the move.
