# Getting started with the ABSmartly LaunchPad

Before you can use the ABsmartly's LaunchPad, you first need to install the Chrome extension and setup the SDK plugin.

## The ABsmartly Chrome Extension

First you need to download and install the LaunchPad as a Chrome extension. This will make it possible to create DOM changes experiments using the Visual Editor.

### Installation

1. Go to the [Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/)
2. Search for **ABsmartly LaunchPad**
3. Click **Add to Chrome**

4. Click on the Chrome Extension's icon
5. Pin the **ABsmartly LaunchPad**

### Configuring the Chrome Extension

1. Click on the LaunchPad's icon to open the extension
2. Click **Configure Settings**.
3. Enter your ABsmartly endpoint address. For example `https://demo-2.absmartly.com` 
4. Select **JWT from Browser Cookie** to use the ABsmartly cookie.
5. Click **Authenticate in ABsmartly** to connect to your ABsmartly's instance.
6. You are now ready to use the ABsmartly's LaunchPad to create new experiments.
7. Check our [how-to guide](creating-an-experiment-with-the-launchpad) to create your first experiment.

### How It Works

The LaunchPad provides a visual editor to create DOM changes which will be applied by the ABsmartly's SDK once the experiment is running.

## The SDK Plugin

To make it possible for the ABsmartly SDK to applies the DOM changes to your website when the experiment is running, 
you need to install the DOM Changes plugin and initialize it after your ABsmartly SDK context is ready. 

### Installation

```bash
npm install @absmartly/sdk-plugins
```

### Basic Setup

```javascript
import { SDK, Context } from '@absmartly/javascript-sdk';
import { DOMChangesPluginLite as DOMChangesPlugin } from '@absmartly/sdk-plugins';

// Initialize your SDK and context
const sdk = new SDK({
  endpoint: 'YOUR_ENDPOINT',
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  environment: 'YOUR_ENVIRONMENT',
  application: 'YOUR_APPLICATION',
});

const context = sdk.createContext({ units: { absId: 'your-unit-id' } });

// Wait for context to be ready
await context.ready();

// Initialize DOM changes plugin
const domPlugin = new DOMChangesPlugin({
  context: context,
  autoApply: true,        // Automatically apply DOM changes
  spa: true,              // Enable SPA support for dynamic content
  visibilityTracking: true, // Track element visibility
  debug: false,           // Enable debug logging
});

await domPlugin.ready();
```

### Configuration Options

- **context**: Your ABsmartly SDK context instance (required)
- **autoApply**: When `true`, automatically applies DOM changes for assigned variants
- **spa**: When `true`, observes DOM changes and reapplies changes for single-page applications
- **visibilityTracking**: When `true`, tracks when modified elements become visible
- **debug**: When `true`, enables detailed console logging for troubleshooting

### How It Works

The DOM Changes plugin:
1. Reads DOM change configurations from your experiment variants
2. Automatically applies the changes for the user's assigned variant
3. Continues to monitor and reapply changes as the DOM updates (when `spa: true`)
4. Tracks element visibility for analytics (when `visibilityTracking: true`)

This plugin works seamlessly with the ABsmartly LaunchPad extension, which allows you to create and manage DOM changes visually through your browser.
