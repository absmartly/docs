# Setting up a Fixed Horizon Experiment

A step by step guide to set up and configure a Fixed Horizon experiment.

## Type of Analysis

A Fixed Horizon test can be configured on the Analysis step (Step 5) of the experimentation setup.
To understand the differences between Group Sequential and Fixed Horizon experiment check our [analysis type article](/docs/web-console-docs/types-of-analysis).

:::info
The default type of analysis for your experiments can be defined in your platform settings.

## Error control

In this section, you can choose the **confidence** and **power** levels for your experiment. 

**Confidence** measures the probability that you would not incorrectly reject the null hypothesis when it is true. 
In other words, it reflects how sure you want to be that a result is not due to random chance.
For example, if your confidence level is 90%, you have a 10% chance of a false positive error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true).
Confidence ensures your findings are robust and minimizes misleading conclusions from noise.

:::caution
The confidence reflects the confidence level for a 2-sided analysis. A 2-sided analysis means that we are testing in both direction, looking for superiority and inferiority.
A 90% confidence in a 2-sided analysis (like we use in Fixed Horizon), means a 5% false positive on each side of the interval (5% of the false positive with be significantly positive and 5% will be significantly negative)
:::

**Power** refers to the ability of a test to detect a true effect when it exists. 
For example, a power of 80% means the test has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a real effect as small as the MDE.
Power ensures your experiment is sensitive enough to detect meaningful changes, especially in cases where the effect sizes are small.

:::info
The minimum and default values for confidence and power levels for your experimentation program can be defined in your platform settings.

## Primary metric

To continue setting up your Fixed Horizon experiment, you first need to select your primary metric. 

:::tip
Choosing the right primary metric can be hard. Below are the main characteristics to consider when choosing your primary metric.

**Aligned:**
Does it reflect the hypothesis? 
The metric should directly reflect the business objective or user outcome that the experiment is intended to improve. 
This alignment ensures that the experiment results drive meaningful business decisions.

**Stable and Reliable:** 
Can it be trusted? The metric should have low variability and provide consistent results over time. 
This minimizes noise and ensures that observed differences are due to the treatment rather than random fluctuations.

**Sensitive:**
Does it respond to the change being tested? A good metric should respond detectably to the changes being tested, even for small effects. 
Sensitivity helps detect meaningful differences without requiring excessively large sample sizes.

**Actionable:** 
Does it provide clear & actionable insights? The metric should guide decisions. 
If the metric increases or decreases, it should provide a clear indication of whether the treatment should be implemented or iterated on.

**Measurable:**
Can it be tracked reliably? The metric should be easy to measure accurately and consistently across all experimental conditions.
:::

If the metric you are selecting is not new and we have already collected data for it, you will see a button to show the metrics performance graph. 

This graph shows the metric's variance and standard deviation over the last 6 weeks for your selected platform(s) and tracking unit (or performance reason, the underlying query samples 10% of overall visitors to compute the results).
This is an indication of what you can expect if you start your experiment now with this metric as your primary metric.


## Adaptive Sample Size

In this section you need to specify a MDE which will be used in the experiment setup.

### Basic

In the basic mode you can simply enter the MDE in the text field.

### Advanced

In the advanced mode you can choose a MDE using the built-in power table.
To estimate the MDE you need to input the conversion rate for binomial metrics or the mean and standard deviation for continuous metrics.
Using the power table you can then choose a relevant MDE based on runtime or sample size for the power level you selected above.
