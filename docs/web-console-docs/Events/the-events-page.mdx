# Events Page

The events page is a great tool for debugging and inspecting goals and exposure events. 
To access it, select `Events` from the sidebar.

## The Events List

When opening the events page, you will be presented with a graph of your 
incoming events and a list of the most recent ones. Events are split into 
two categories - `Exposures` and `Goals`.

### Exposure Events

[Exposure events](exposure-events) are sent by our SDKs when the `treatment` function is called. 
The treatment function asks our platform which variant a participant should 
see and returns a number between `0` and `3`. 

### Goal Events

[Goal events](goal-events) are sent by the SDKs when the `track` function is called and they
include any properties that were passed along with it.

### Raw Event JSON

Clicking on a single event will bring up a dialog box with the event's raw JSON data:

Check the [Exposure events](exposure-events) and [Goal events](goal-events) pages for more details on those events

## Events Filters

For debugging it can be useful to filter the incoming events to narrow them 
down to the specific events that you are looking for.

The available filters are as follows:

### Application

Select the application(s) that you want to see events from. Applications are 
created and edited in the [Dashboard Settings](/docs/web-console-docs/settings).

### Unit Type

Select which unit types you want to see events from. Common unit types are `user_id`
or `anonymous_id`, but they could be anything depending on your setup. Unit 
Types can be created in the [Dashboard Settings](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#units). 

### Event Type

Filter your events to only show `exposure` events or `goal` events, as 
described above. This filter can also be preselected by choosing a type when 
clicking on the `Events` sidebar navigation.

### Event Name

The event name can be extremely useful for debugging. For exposure events, the 
event name will be the name of the experiment that was exposed. For goal events, 
the event name will be the name of the goal that was tracked.

### Environment Type

Choose whether to see events from either only Development environments or only 
Production environments. Both types of environment can be set up in the
[Dashboard Settings](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#environments). 

### Unit UID

The Unit UID is the most specific form of filtering in the events page. As 
mentioned above, each event will be sent with a unique unit - often `user_id` 
or `anonymous_id`. These values, when passed into the SDKs, are hashed and 
sent to our platform in an encrypted form. If you only want to see values that 
have been sent by yourself, you can copy and paste your Unit UID hash into 
this box and only your own events will appear in the list.
