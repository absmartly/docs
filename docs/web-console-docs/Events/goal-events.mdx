# Goal Events

## Capturing user actions

Goal events are sent by the SDKs when the `track` function is called. 
Those events capture visitor actions (`page view`, `button clicked`, `purchase`, etc) with optional contextual data like `price`, `quantity`, and `product_id`, etc.

```javascript
// Triggered when a visitor buys a product
context.track("purchase", {
  price: 1000,
  currency: "euro",
  order_number: "0000982532",
  product_id: "ABC123",
  category_id: "ZYZ123"
});
```

Before sending goal events, make sure to correctly initialize the ABsmartly context and enrich it with the visitor's attributes.
See the [visitor's identity page](visitors-identity) for more details.

## The events page

As soon as your code is deployed and visitors trigger the action, goal events will start being appearing in the ABsmartly's [events' page](the-events-page).

You can use this page while debugging and to ensure that events are correctly been triggered when users perform a specific action on your application.

## Understanding goal events 

You can click any event on the events' page to inspect the event.

```json
{
  "event_type": "goal",
  "unit_uid": "LTSLmGJb-oGQVJhxElUwtQ",
  "unit_uid_hex": "2d348b98625bfa8190549871125530b5",
  "unit_type": "absId",
  "unit_type_id": 42,
  "agent": "absmartly-javascript-sdk",
  "application": "absmartly.com",
  "application_id": 39,
  "environment": "Prod",
  "environment_id": 3,
  "environment_type": "production",
  "event_at": 1763124336749,
  "goal_id": 106,
  "goal_name": "purchase",
  "properties": {
    "price": 1000,
    "currency": "euro",
    "order_number": "0000982532",
    "product_id": "ABC123",
    "category_id": "ZYZ123"
  }
}
```

Below is an overview of some of the data you will find in the exposure event's raw data.

| Field | Description |

| **event_type** | This indicates the sort of event. In this case, `goal`. |
| **unit_type**| The sort of unit used to identify the visitor. |
| **unit_uid**| The visitor's unique identifier for this unit type. One event is sent for each register identifier. |
| **application**| Indicates the application where this event comes from. |
| **event_at**| The event's timestamp. |
| **unit_attributes** | The list of visitor's attributes registered for this event. |
| **goal_id**| The goal's id. |
| **goal_name**| The goals's name. |
| **properties**| The list of all properties associated with this goal. Those can used as part of the metric computation. |


## Events info & warning
