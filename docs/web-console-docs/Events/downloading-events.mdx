# Downloading Events

Raw event data can be downloaded directly from an experiment's overview page or from the [Events Page](the-events-page).

## From the Experiment's overview

Downloading events data directly from an experiment makes it easy to download all experiment related data in a single file directly into your computer.

To download an experiment's raw event data

- Navigate to an experiment's overview.
- Click the ... in the top right.
- Select `Export Data` from the dropdown. This option will only be visible if you have the correct permissions to download raw data.
- An export request is made a processed asynchronously.
- When the export file is ready a notification will show on the report's activity tab.
- Click on the link to download the raw data file.

:::Note
The link to download the file us only valid for 30 days. A new request can be made if the link as expired.

## From the Event's page

Downloading events from the Events page makes it possible to select which events will be downloaded and does not restrict events from a single experiment.

### Exporting Events

To set up a new export, click `Export` in the top-right hand corner.

Here you will be able to set up an export configuration that runs either once,
or recurrently.

#### Configure Export

The first step on the exporter form is to give your configuration a name and 
to select how often you want it to run. This can be once, hourly, daily, 
weekly or monthly.

#### Filter Events

As mentioned in the [Event Filters section](#event-filters), you can filter 
your events to fine tune what kind of events are exported. The `Start At` 
field is required and is the date and time of the earliest event that you want 
to export. For recurring exports, after the first export, the `Start At` event 
will be the next event after the last one that was previously exported.

#### Configure Storage

The `Configure Storage` section is where you will input the details of your 
storage bucket. The fields are described in the following table:

| Field Name      | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bucket**      | The name of the object storage bucket to export into.                         |
| **Prefix**      | The prefix of the exported filename, which can include / to denote "sub-folders". |
| **Access Key ID**  | The access key id of for the object storage bucket.                           |
| **Secret Key**  | The secret access key for the object storage bucket.                          |
| **Endpoint**    | The S3-compatible endpoint to connect to the object storage bucket. **Examples:**<br /> AWS: https://s3.amazonaws.com<br />GCP: https://storage.googleapis.com<br />|
| **Format**      | The format of the exported data. CSV and TSV include a header row with column names. JSON is a newline-delimited JSON file. Parquet is a very efficient column oriented storage format.|
| **Compression** | The compression method to use. GZIP is widely supported and provides good compression. ZSTD is similar to GZIP in compression level but faster, and less widely supported. LZ4 is much faster but provides slightly less compression. None is no compression. |

:::info Interoperability with GCP to S3
1. Go to the [Cloud Storage Settings page](http://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings/) in the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. In Settings, select **Interoperability**.
3. If interoperability has not been set up yet, click **Enable Interoperability Access**.
