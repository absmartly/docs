# Creating A Feature Flag

Feature flags allow you to easily turn features on and off within the 
ABsmartly platform, without having to go through the entire experimentat 
creation process. This is useful for testing new or error-prone features.

## Basics

Similar to experiments, feature flags have a name and an optional display name, 
which can be set here. The name is used in your code to check if the feature 
flag is enabled or not, but the display name will be shown in the ABsmartly 
dashboard.

## Variants

Feature flags can have up to four variants. Each variant can be given a name, 
have screenshots added to it and can be assigned some [variant variables](/docs/SDK-Documentation/basic-usage#treatment-variables).

## Audiences

The audiences step allows you to choose who will see your feature flag. You 
choose your [unit type](/docs/web-console-docs/configuration/units), 
and [applications](/docs/web-console-docs/configuration/applications) 
and can then select a targeting audience to refine the flag to a specific group of users.

## Metrics

In this step, you can choose which metrics you want to track for the duration of your 
feature flag. Unlike experiments though, feature flag primary metrics are not 
required.

## Metadata

Here, you can add any additional metadata to your feature flag. This step can 
be customised in [the Platform Settings](/docs/web-console-docs/configuration/settings#platform-settings) 
to include any other fields you may need.

## Review

The review step allows you to check over all the details of your feature flag 
before saving, starting it in development or starting it in production.
