# The Events Page

The events page is a great tool for debugging the relationship between your 
code and the Web Console. To access it, select `Events` from the sidebar and 
choose `All`.

## The Events List

<Image img="events_list.png" alt="A screenshot of the events page on the A/B Smartly web console" />

When opening the events page, you will be presented with a graph of your 
incoming events and a list of the most recent ones. Events can be split into 
two categories - `Exposures` and `Goals`.

### Exposure Events

Exposure events are sent by our SDKs when the `treatment` function is called. 
The treatment function asks our platform which variant a participant should 
see and returns a number between `0` and `3`. When this question has been asked,
we say that the user has been **exposed** to the experiment.

### Goal Events

Goal events are sent by the SDKs when the `track` function is called and they
include any properties that were passed along with it.

## Raw Event JSON

Clicking on a single event will bring up a dialog box with the event's raw JSON data:

## Event Filters

For debugging it can be useful to filter the incoming events to narrow them 
down to the specific events that you are looking for.

The available filters are as follows:

### Application

Select the application(s) that you want to see events from. Applications are 
created and edited in the [Dashboard Settings](/docs/web-console-docs/settings).


### Unit Type

Select which unit types you want to see events from. Common unit types are `user_id`
or `anonymous_id`, but they could be anything depending on your setup. Unit 
Types can be created in the [Dashboard Settings](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#units). 

### Event Type

Filter your events to only show `exposure` events or `goal` events, as 
described above. This filter can also be preselected by choosing a type when 
clicking on the `Events` sidebar navigation.

### Event Name

The event name can be extremely useful for debugging. For exposure events, the 
event name will be the name of the experiment that was exposed. For goal events, 
the event name will be the name of the goal that was tracked.

### Environment Type

Choose whether to see events from either only Development environments or only 
Production environments. Both types of environment can be set up in the
[Dashboard Settings](/docs/web-console-docs/settings#environments). 

### Unit UID

The Unit UID is the most specific form of filtering in the events page. As 
mentioned above, each event will be sent with a unique unit - often `user_id` 
or `anonymous_id`. These values, when passed into the SDKs, are hashed and 
sent to our platform in an encrypted form. If you only want to see values that 
have been sent by yourself, you can copy and paste your Unit UID hash into 
this box and only your own events will appear in the list.

## The Exporter

<Image img="export_configs_list.png" alt="A screenshot of the export configurations list" />

ABsmartly also has functionality for exporting your events. To do this, click 
on `Events` in the sidebar and select `Export Configurations`.

Here you will be presented with a list of any previously run export 
configurations. For more information on any particular configuration, you can 
click on it.

### Exporting Events

To create a new export configuration, click `Export` in the top-right hand corner.

<Image img="export_events_create.png" alt="A screenshot of the export configurations create page" />

Here you will be able to setup an export configuration that runs either once, 
or recurrently.

#### Configure Export

The first step on the exporter form is to give your configuration a name and 
to select how often you want it to run. This can be once, hourly, daily, 
weekly or monthly.

#### Filter Events

As mentioned in the [Event Filters section](#event-filters), you can filter 
your events to fine tune what kind of events are exported. The `Start At` 
field is required and is the date and time of the earliest event that you want 
to export. For recurring exports, after the first export, the `Start At` event 
will be the next event after the last one that was previously exported.

#### Configure Storage

The `Configure Storage` section is where you will input the details of your 
storage bucket. The fields are described in the following table:

| Field Name      | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bucket**      | The name of the bucket that you want to export to.                            |
| **Prefix**      | The prefix of the exported filename.                                          |
| **Access Key**  | The client access key of your storage bucket.                                 |
| **Secret Key**  | The secret key of your storage bucket.                                        |
| **Endpoint**    | The endpoint that points to your storage bucket.                              |
| **Format**      | The format of the exported data. We currently support [CSV](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comma-separated_values) and [JSON](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/JSON).           |
| **Compression** | The compression method to use on the data. We currently support [GZIP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gzip) and [LZ4](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/LZ4_(compression_algorithm)). |

Once all of these fields have been filled, you must use the `Test Configuration` 
button to make sure that the fields have been filled correctly. If the test is 
successful, you can click the `Export Events` button to start exporting!
