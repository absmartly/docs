# Dashboard Settings

The dashboard settings page is your place to set up parts of your experiments.

## Applications

Here you can declare all of the platforms where your experiments may run. When
creating an experiment, you will be asked to name all applications where the
experiment will be run.

## API Keys

API keys are used to allow access to the API from your applications.

Each key can have 3 permissions:

- Making requests to the SDK
- Accessing the SDK context endpoint
- Fetching experiment data from the API

API keys are independent of environments. The same key can be used in both `production`
and `development` environments.

## CORS Origins

In CORS Origins, you can declare all the domains which are allowed to access
the API. These can be written as a specific domain or you can pass in a
[RegEx](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Cheatsheet)
pattern to allow for a myriad of domains.

## Environments

Environments can be of type `production` or `development`. You can have as many
environments of each type as necessary.

Production environments will only be running `production` experiments.
Development environments run both `production` and `development` experiments, but
`development` experiments only collect data from `development` environments, and
`production` experiments only collect data from `production` environments.

## Goals

Goals are the names given to processes that you will later track in your code.

The goal name will be used in your code, so we recommend using a keyword-like
or kebab-case name. For example, `newsletter_subscription`, `cpu_load_time` or
`bookings`.

## Metrics

Metrics are the parameters that will be used to track your goals. They can
give you insights about your business, your users' behavior, the performance
of your system and more!

For more information on creating a Metric, see the
[Creating a Metric section of the Getting Started guide](/docs/web-console-docs/tutorial#creating-a-metric)!

## Roles

The Roles section allows you to customize and give specific permissions to the users of your
Web Console.

## Segments

Segments are used to slice up your metrics based on different attributes. For
example, you may be passing the following as attributes in an experiment:

```js
context.attributes({
	customer_age: 'new_customer',
	url: location.toString(),
	user_agent: navigator.userAgent
	referrer: document.referrer,
	screenName,
	pageName,
	country: headers['HTTP_CF_IPCOUNTRY'],
	language: headers['Accept-Language'],
 	channel: query_params.utm_medium,
})
```

If the `utm_medium` is something that would be interesting to segment the data
on, you could create a **Channel** segment with the **Source attribute** set to
**channel**.

Additionally, if you have the User-Agent parser turned on, ABsmartly will parse the UA
string passed on the `user_agent` attribute and automatically create the
following attributes for you:

- `user_agent/browser`: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari...
- `user_agent/browser_type`: Browser, Email, Crawler...
- `user_agent/device_type`: Desktop, Mobile, Tablet...
- `user_agent/platform`: Android, iOS, Mac OS X, Windows...
- `user_agent/crawler`: yes, no

Pass one of those keys in the **Source attribute** field to automatically
create a segment based on the respective information from the User-Agent
string.

## Tags

Both experiments and goals can be given tags. This can be useful for searching
through your goals and experiments to find a specific one.

We recommend prefixing each tag with the tag's type. For example,
`location:Header`, `stack:Backend` or `psychological:Trust`.

## Teams

In the teams section, you can declare the teams that will be running
experiments. This will allow you to assign and search for experiments by a
specific team.

## Units

Units are the unique identifiers that are going to be used to generate a variant.
For experiments running across different platforms (iOS, Android, web, email, etc.) the
unit should be known across all the platforms. Most likely the authenticated
user's `user-id`. For experiments running in apps or parts of the website where
the user is not authenticated, you might want to create a unit by device.
`anonymous-id` or `device-id` are common names for those.

For experiments running in email newsletters, you could even have a unit based
on the user’s email address, but if you are interested in collecting metrics
tracked in the website that the newsletter is linking to, it’s better to use
the same unit that is being used for the experiments running in the website.

Have a look at the [Tracking Unit](/docs/web-console-docs/creating-an-experiment#tracking-unit)
section of the **Creating an Experiment** docs for more information.

## Users

In Users, you can create and give permissions to the users who should have
access to the platform.

## Webhooks

Webhooks can be used for custom integrations. For example:

- Invalidating the CDN’s cache of the data file with any experiment being
  started or stopped.
- Sending all actions, notifications, and comments to a Slack channel.
- Synchronizing the status of a Jira ticket with the status of the respective
  experiment.

Have a look at our [Slack integration guide](/docs/examples/slack-integration) for an example of how to use Webhooks,
or checkout our [example Github repository](https://github.com/absmartly/examples/tree/main/Javascript/slack-integration)
for a more comprehensive code example!

Webhooks are available for all experiment, goal and metric events on the Web Console, namely:

- Experiment Created
- Experiment Started in Development
- Experiment Started
- Experiment Stopped
- Experiment Restarted
- Experiment Put Full On
- Experiment Edited
- Experiment Commented On
- Experiment Archived
- Experiment Unarchived
- Experiment Alert Created
- Goal Archived
- Goal Created
- Goal Edited
- Metric Archived
- Metric Created
- Metric Edited

## Platform Settings

The Platform settings page allows you to choose whether your experiments'
description fields are `optional`, `required` or `hidden`.
